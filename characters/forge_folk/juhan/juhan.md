## Young Apprentice Juhan

A boy of about 15, eager to learn the blacksmithing trade. He is scrawny but strong, with a perpetually soot-smudged face and a hopeful expression.

### Visual Description
Juhan is a youth of 15, standing at an average height with a lean, wiry build that hints at growing strength. His face, often smudged with soot, is framed by a mop of unruly, shoulder-length brown hair. His eyes are a bright, inquisitive hazel, and his features are still soft with youth. He wears a simple, sleeveless leather jerkin over a coarse, earth-toned linen tunic, and his trousers are made of a sturdy, dark wool. The clothes are practical for his work, showing signs of wear and mending.

### Motivations
- **To Prove Himself:** Juhan is driven by a desire to become a master blacksmith, respected for his skill. He wants to prove his worth to Old Toomas and the other members of the guild.
- **To Help His Family:** Juhan comes from a poor family, and he sees his apprenticeship as a way to provide a better life for them.
- **Curiosity:** He is naturally curious and eager to learn, not just about blacksmithing, but about the world outside the forge.

### Ties & Relationships
- **Allies:**
    - **Old Toomas:** Juhan sees Toomas as a grandfather figure and a source of immense knowledge. He is fiercely loyal to the old blacksmith and hangs on his every word.
    - **Kalev (The Player):** Juhan looks up to Kalev as a role model. He is eager to help the player in any way he can, hoping to learn from his experience.
- **Enemies:**
    - None, initially. Juhan is young and naive, and he has not yet made any enemies.
- **Initial View of the Main Player:** Juhan is immediately impressed by Kalev and is eager to befriend him. He sees the player as a figure of adventure and excitement.

### History (Biography)
Juhan was born in the eastern quarter of Reval, the eldest son of a charcoal burner. From a young age, he was fascinated by the nearby forges, spending hours watching the blacksmiths at their work. When he was old enough, he begged his father to let him become an apprentice. His father, seeing the boy's passion, agreed to let him train under the master of the Iron Guild. Juhan is a quick learner and has a natural talent for the craft, but he is still young and has much to learn about the world and its dangers.

### Daily Routines
- **All Day:** Juhan spends most of his days at the Iron Guild Hall, working the bellows, fetching coal, and learning the basics of the blacksmithing trade from the guild members.
- **Evening:** In the evenings, he returns to his family's small hut on the edge of the quarter.

### Possible Quest Lines
- **The Apprentice's First Blade:** Juhan needs help gathering the materials to forge his first sword. This could be a simple fetch quest that introduces the player to some of the resource-gathering mechanics of the game.
- **A Lesson in Steel:** Juhan has been tasked with creating a special alloy, but he is missing a key ingredient. He asks the player to find it for him, leading to an adventure outside the city walls.
- **The Bully:** A larger, older apprentice from another guild has been bullying Juhan. The player can choose to intervene, either through diplomacy or force.
