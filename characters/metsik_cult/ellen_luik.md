# Ellen Luik

**Visual Description:** The enigmatic high priestess of the cult. She is a powerful seer and a master of spirit magic, offering you access to ancient rituals, animal allies, and the raw, untamed power of the land itself. Her motives are cryptic, and her loyalty is to the spirits, not to any mortal cause. She seems to tell stories to children that surround her. She has long, dark hair, and her eyes seem to hold ancient secrets. She wears clothes made of natural fibers, adorned with feathers, bones, and other items from the forest.
