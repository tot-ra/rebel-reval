# Bishop Hermann II Osenbrügge


![](./hermann.png)
## Visual Description

Hermann is a man in his late 50s, with a commanding presence that speaks more of political acumen than physical strength. His figure is lean, shaped by years of disciplined, ascetic life. His face is long and narrow, with high cheekbones and thoughtful, deep-set grey eyes that seem to assess everything with a calm, calculating gaze. Thin, pale lips are often set in a neutral line, rarely breaking into a smile. His silver-grey hair is cut short and neatly combed, receding at the temples, revealing a high forehead. His skin is pale, almost like parchment, and etched with fine lines of worry around his eyes and mouth.

He is typically dressed in the robes of a Prince-Bishop, favoring function over excessive opulence. His attire consists of a fine, dark wool cassock, perhaps in a deep purple or black, worn under a simple white rochet of fine linen. The fabric is of high quality but without extravagant embroidery. Over this, for formal occasions, he wears a cappa magna, a voluminous ceremonial cape, its color denoting the liturgical season. His only sign of office is a simple, unadorned silver pectoral cross hanging from a plain cord around his neck.

## History (Biography)

Born into the lesser Westphalian nobility of the House of Osenbrügge (near modern-day Osnabrück), Hermann was a second son destined for the Church from a young age. He proved to be an astute student of canon law and theology, and his sharp intellect and diplomatic skills saw him rise steadily through the ecclesiastical ranks in the Holy Roman Empire. His appointment to the see of Ösel-Wiek in 1338 was a political one, intended to place a shrewd and loyal German prince on a remote but strategic outpost of Christendom.

His early reign was immediately tested by the St. George's Night Uprising (1343-1345). While the rebellion primarily targeted the Danish and Livonian Order territories, its shockwaves were felt across Livonia. Hermann had to navigate a treacherous path: reasserting control over the native Estonian populace without appearing weak, while simultaneously resisting the "helpful" interventions of the Livonian Order, who used the crisis to expand their own influence. This experience solidified his pragmatic and cautious nature, teaching him that the Order was a far greater long-term threat to his sovereignty than any peasant revolt. He has spent the years since playing a delicate game of diplomacy, balancing the powers of the region to safeguard his small, sea-bound principality.

## Motivations

*   **Preserve Sovereignty at All Costs:** His primary and all-consuming goal. He sees the Livonian Order not as a partner but as a predator waiting for any sign of weakness to devour his bishopric. Every decision is weighed against how it will affect his independence.
*   **Maintain Maritime Lifeline:** The sea is both his shield and his source of wealth. He is determined to protect the trade routes from pirates and ensure the ports of Haapsalu and Kuressaare remain profitable and under his firm control.
*   **Internal Stability through Control:** Having witnessed the chaos of the uprising, he is wary of his own vassals and the local Estonian nobility. He seeks to keep them pacified and loyal, using a combination of patronage, law, and the threat of force to prevent any internal dissent that the Order could exploit.
*   **Build a Counterweight Coalition:** He knows he cannot stand against the Order alone. He constantly sends missives and envoys to the Archbishop of Riga and the Bishop of Dorpat, seeking to forge a united front of bishops to counterbalance the Order's military might.

## Ties & Relationships

*   **Allies:**
    *   **Bishop of Dorpat & Archbishop of Riga:** Cautious and conditional allies. They share his distrust of the Livonian Order, but their own ambitions and rivalries often prevent a truly united front. Hermann views them as necessary but unreliable partners.
*   **Enemies:**
    *   **The Livonian Order:** His principal adversary. He views the local Master and his commanders as ambitious, ruthless, and untrustworthy. He engages with them diplomatically but prepares for conflict, seeing their every move as part of a larger scheme to annex his lands.
    *   **Pirates (Vitalienbrüder):** A persistent thorn in his side, disrupting trade and terrorizing his coastline. He lacks the naval power to eliminate them and must rely on hired privateers or appeals to the Hanseatic League for protection.
*   **Complicated:**
    *   **The Cathedral Chapter:** A source of internal friction. The canons are powerful men with their own interests. While they support him publicly, some may resent his authority or be susceptible to bribes and whispers from the Order.
    *   **The Hanseatic League:** A vital economic partner but also a demanding one. He needs their trade but chafes under their legal and economic pressure, often finding himself in disputes over taxes and port rights.
*   **Initial View of the Main Player:**
    *   Hermann would view the player with extreme caution and suspicion. He would see them as a new, unpredictable piece on the board. He would seek to determine their loyalties and usefulness, potentially employing them for deniable tasks that he cannot entrust to his own men. Gaining his trust would be a long and difficult process, requiring absolute loyalty and proven results.

## Daily Routines

His days are structured and disciplined. He rises before dawn for private prayer in his chapel, followed by Mass. The morning is consumed by administrative duties: reviewing tax receipts, dictating letters to other rulers, hearing petitions from his subjects, and meeting with his Knight Commander to discuss the bishopric's defenses. The afternoon is for diplomacy and council meetings with his canons, where strategies for dealing with the Order are debated. Evenings are spent in quiet study of scripture and law, or in discreet meetings with spies and informants who bring him news from across Livonia.

## Possible Quest Lines

*   **The Pirate's Nest:** The Bishop tasks the player with locating and eliminating a pirate captain who has been preying on ships near Hiiumaa, offering a charter and a share of the recovered loot.
*   **A Serpent in the Chapter:** Hermann suspects one of his own canons is leaking information to the Livonian Order. He asks the player to investigate discreetly and find proof of the betrayal without causing a public scandal.
*   **The Contested Island:** A dispute erupts with the Livonian Order over the fishing and logging rights on a small, strategically located island. The player is sent to negotiate on the Bishop's behalf, a mission that could easily turn violent.
*   **The Bishop's Envoy:** The player is entrusted with a secret missive for the Archbishop of Riga, a dangerous journey through Order-controlled territory, tasked with forging a secret military alliance.
