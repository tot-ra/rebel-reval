# Bishop Hermann II Osenbrügge

## History and Political Situation (1338-1362)

Hermann II Osenbrügge was the Prince-Bishop of Ösel–Wiek from 1338 until his death in 1362. His reign occurred during a period of relative stability in Livonia, following the turmoil of the St. George's Night Uprising. However, the political landscape was still dominated by the powerful Livonian Order, and the bishops of Livonia had to constantly navigate their relationship with the Order to maintain their autonomy.
