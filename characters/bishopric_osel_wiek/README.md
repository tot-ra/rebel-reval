# Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek

## History and Political Situation (1340-1345)

The Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek was a unique entity in the Livonian Confederation, a maritime principality ruling over the islands of Saaremaa (Ösel) and Hiiumaa (Dagö), and a strip of the mainland (Wiek). This geography defined its character: it was more connected to the sea than the inland politics of Livonia, yet it could not escape the influence of its powerful neighbors.

The relationship with the **Livonian Order** was one of long and often bitter compromise. A significant portion of the bishopric's territory, including a third of Saaremaa itself, had been ceded to the Order in the 13th century. This created a permanent source of tension and a powerful internal rival. Bishop Hermann II Osenbrügge (1338-1362) spent his reign trying to maintain a delicate balance, preserving his remaining autonomy against the Order's relentless ambition, which had only grown after its role in crushing the St. George's Night Uprising.

The aftermath of the uprising (1343-1345) left the bishopric in a vulnerable position. The bishop had to reassert control over a restive native population while being wary of the Order's "assistance." The purchase of the Duchy of Estonia by the Order in 1346 would further isolate the bishopric, surrounding it with Order-controlled lands and sea lanes. This maritime position also meant the bishop had to contend with the ever-present threat of pirates, including the notorious Vitalienbrüder, who could disrupt trade and raid coastal settlements.

## Motivations and Goals

*   **Preserve Independence:** The absolute primary goal. Every political and diplomatic decision was aimed at preventing the Livonian Order from absorbing the bishopric.
*   **Maritime Control:** Protecting the sea lanes from pirates and ensuring the flow of trade to its ports (like Haapsalu and Kuressaare) was vital for the bishopric's economic survival.
*   **Internal Stability:** After the trauma of the uprising, the bishop needed to pacify the local Estonian nobility and peasantry, often through a mix of force and diplomacy, to prevent another rebellion that the Order could exploit.
*   **Diplomatic Maneuvering:** Bishop Hermann II was a shrewd diplomat, constantly seeking alliances with the Archbishop of Riga, the Bishop of Dorpat, and even foreign powers like Denmark or Sweden to create a coalition to counterbalance the Livonian Order.

## Dislikes and Conflicts

*   **The Livonian Order:** The main rival and threat. The Order was seen as a voracious predator, constantly seeking to chip away at the bishopric's lands and sovereignty.
*   **Pirates (Vitalienbrüder):** A direct threat to the bishopric's economic lifeline. Their raids disrupted trade, terrorized coastal communities, and required costly defensive measures.
*   **Internal Canons:** The cathedral chapter was a powerful body within the bishopric, and as the later 14th century would show with the murder of Bishop Heinrich III, they could become a dangerous source of internal opposition if their own power and wealth were threatened.
*   **The Hanseatic League:** While a crucial trading partner, the League's interests did not always align with the Bishop's. Disputes over taxes, port fees, and legal jurisdiction were common.

## Core NPCs

*   **Bishop Hermann II de Osenbrygge:** The ruling Prince-Bishop. A seasoned and pragmatic leader, he is more of a diplomat and administrator than a warrior, forced to navigate the treacherous political waters of Livonia to protect his small, sea-bordered state.
*   **A Knight Commander:** The loyal commander of the Bishop's forces, responsible for defending the castles at Haapsalu and Kuressaare. He is constantly stretched thin, dealing with threats from the Order, potential uprisings, and pirate raids.
*   **A Canon of the Cathedral Chapter:** An influential and ambitious member of the Bishop's council. He may secretly resent the Bishop's authority and could be in quiet negotiations with the Livonian Order for his own benefit.
*   **A Sea Captain:** A salty, experienced mariner who trades in the Bishop's ports. He brings news from across the Baltic and may act as a privateer for the Bishop, or alternately, have dealings with pirates himself.

## Governance and Daily Life

The Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek was a maritime state, and its daily life and governance were shaped by the sea.

*   **Governance:** The Prince-Bishop ruled from his main castles at Haapsalu on the mainland and Kuressaare on the island of Saaremaa. He governed through a chapter of canons who acted as his council and administrators. A key feature of Ösel-Wiek's governance was the constant tension with the Livonian Order, which controlled a third of Saaremaa, creating a state-within-a-state and a permanent source of friction and jurisdictional disputes.
*   **Military:** The Bishop's military forces were modest and primarily defensive. They consisted of a small number of household knights and a levy of local vassals. Their main purpose was to garrison the bishop's castles and patrol the coast against pirate raids. The bishopric's naval power was likely limited to a few armed merchant vessels that could be pressed into service as a patrol force. For any major military campaign, they were dependent on alliances with other bishoprics or the Livonian Order.
*   **Economy and Taxation:** The economy was heavily reliant on the sea. Fishing, shipbuilding, and maritime trade were the main sources of wealth. The bishopric also derived income from its agricultural estates on the mainland and the islands. Taxes were collected on trade goods passing through its ports, on fish catches, and from agricultural produce. This income was crucial for maintaining the bishop's court and his small military force.
*   **Religion and Clergy:** The bishopric was responsible for the spiritual welfare of the coastal and island communities. This included a mix of German and Danish merchants and landowners, and the native Estonian population. The clergy, based in the cathedrals of Haapsalu and Kuressaare, would have included a number of priests and monks who also managed the church's extensive landholdings. The relative isolation of the islands may have meant that pre-Christian traditions survived longer here than in other parts of Livonia.
