# "Ironhand" Störtebeker

**Visual Description:** A grizzled and pragmatic pirate captain who leads the largest band of Vitalienbrüder in the Baltic. He is a man of his word, but his word is always backed by a sharp axe and a lust for gold. He is a mountain of a man, with a wild beard and a patch over one eye. He is covered in scars and tattoos, and he wears a motley collection of stolen finery. He has a booming laugh and a fierce temper.
