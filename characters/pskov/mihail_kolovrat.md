# Михаил Коловрат

**Visual Description:**
Михаил is a man in his late 30s, with a lean, wiry build honed by years in the wilderness. His face is weathered and tanned from the sun and wind, with a network of fine lines around his sharp, intelligent grey eyes. He has medium-length, dark brown hair that is often unkempt and pushed back from his face. He wears practical, durable clothing made of dark leather and rough, grey-brown furs, designed for camouflage and protection from the elements. The clothes are well-maintained but show signs of frequent use.

**Motivations:**
To secure Pskov's independence from Novgorod and the Livonian Order. He is a staunch advocate for the common people, fighting against the corruption of the boyars and the exploitation of the poor. He dreams of a Pskov where every citizen has a voice and a stake in the city's future.

**Ties & Relationships:**
- **Allies:** He has a wide network of informants and supporters among the trappers, hunters, and peasants of the Pskov lands. He is respected by the common soldiers and some of the younger, more idealistic members of the lesser nobility.
- **Enemies:** The wealthy boyars of Pskov who see him as a threat to their power. He is also a known enemy of the Livonian Order and the more aggressive factions within Novgorod.
- **Initial view of the main player:** Cautious and suspicious. He will test the player's motives and skills before revealing his true intentions. He is looking for a reliable ally who shares his vision for Pskov.

**History (Biography):**
Born into a family of poor trappers, Михаил learned the ways of the forest from a young age. He witnessed firsthand the injustices faced by the common people at the hands of the powerful boyars and foreign invaders. He joined the Pskov militia as a young man and quickly distinguished himself as a skilled scout and warrior. After a series of brutal skirmishes with the Livonian Order, he became disillusioned with the leadership of the boyars and began to build his own network of loyal followers. He now operates as a semi-independent agent, working to protect Pskov from its enemies, both within and without.

**Daily Routines:**
By day, he is a simple fur trapper, checking his lines and trading his wares in the markets of Pskov. By night, he meets with his network of spies, gathers intelligence, and plans his operations. He sleeps in hidden camps in the forest or in safe houses within the city walls. He is a man of simple habits, more comfortable in the wilderness than in the halls of power.

**Possible Quest Lines:**

***Chapter 1: Before the Uprising (1342)***

- **The Disappearing Trappers:** Several Pskovian fur trappers have gone missing near the Livonian border. Михаил suspects they have been captured or killed by the Order. He asks the player to investigate their last known whereabouts, which leads to a tense confrontation with a knight from the local commandery.
- **A Voice for the Voiceless:** A corrupt boyar in Pskov is imposing illegal taxes on the peasants and seizing their land. Михаил tasks the player with gathering evidence of the boyar's crimes and rallying the support of the common people to bring him to justice before the Veche (the Pskov assembly).
- **The Novgorod Gambit:** The player must infiltrate the Novgorodian trade delegation in Reval to gather intelligence on their plans for Pskov. This quest line will bring the player into direct conflict with Яна Подаяльная, who is trying to undermine Pskov's independence.

***Chapter 2: During the Uprising (1343-1345)***

- **The Padise Monastery Massacre:** News of the massacre at Padise Monastery reaches Pskov. Михаил, seeing an opportunity to strike at the Order while they are distracted, asks the player to guide a Pskovian warband through the forests to raid a supply convoy heading for the Order's main army.
- **The Four Kings:** The player is tasked with escorting an envoy from the four Estonian "kings" to Pskov to plead for military aid. The player must navigate through territory controlled by the Livonian Order and deal with the political machinations of the Pskovian boyars, some of whom are in the pay of Novgorod.
- **The Battle of Kanavere Bog:** The player is sent to act as a scout for the Pskovian army, gathering intelligence on the Livonian Order's movements. The player will witness the brutal aftermath of the Battle of Kanavere Bog and must report back to Pskov, influencing their decision on whether to intervene directly in the conflict.
- **The Siege of Reval:** While the main rebel army is besieging Reval, Михаил wants to take advantage of the chaos. He sends the player into the besieged city to make contact with a network of sympathetic Estonian merchants and artisans, with the goal of establishing a pro-Pskov faction within the city walls.
