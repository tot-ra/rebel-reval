# Jüri Ratnik

**Visual Description:** A former manor blacksmith from Läänemaa who forged weapons and alliances alike. Called "Iron Hand" by his followers, feared by knights for his brutal efficiency. He is a large, muscular man with soot-stained hands and a grim expression. His arms are corded with muscle from years of smithing, and he carries a heavy war hammer that he made himself.
