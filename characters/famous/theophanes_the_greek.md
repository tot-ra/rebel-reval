# Theophanes the Greek (b. c. 1330)

**Visual Description:**
At 13, Theophanes is a youth caught between boyhood and adolescence, with an intensity that belies his age. He is slight of build, with dark, unruly hair that often falls into his piercing, dark eyes. His complexion is olive, typical of his Byzantine Greek heritage, standing in contrast to the paler tones of the locals. He dresses in the simple, practical tunic of an apprentice, made of dark, earth-toned wool, though it is of a finer cut and fabric than those of local boys. His hands are perpetually stained with charcoal and pigment. He is often quiet and watchful, absorbing every detail of his surroundings with a startling focus, his gaze lingering on the play of light on stone or the expressions on faces in the crowd.

**Motivations:**
- To learn and master the art of icon painting, driven by a burning passion for his craft.
- To find a way to survive the chaos of the uprising and protect his patron.
- To understand the strange, "barbaric" art and culture of this cold northern land, seeing it as both unsettling and fascinating.

**Ties & Relationships:**
- **Allies:** His primary ally is his patron, a Genoese merchant named Niccolò. He would also seek out the company of other artists, craftsmen, or clergy who might offer him shelter, knowledge, or a scrap of parchment to draw on.
- **Enemies:** He is fearful of the raw violence of both the rebels and the Order knights. He would be a target due to his foreign appearance and association with a wealthy merchant.
- **Initial view of the main player:** He would view the player with a mixture of fear and fascination. As a non-combatant and an observer, he would see the player as a powerful force of action, a figure of immense interest to be sketched from a safe distance.

**History (Biography):**
Born in the vibrant heart of the declining Byzantine Empire, Constantinople, Theophanes was recognized as an artistic prodigy from a young age. His talent for capturing spiritual intensity in his drawings caught the eye of Niccolò, a wealthy Genoese merchant who traded in Byzantine silks and icons. Seeing a rare genius, Niccolò took the boy on as his protégé, intending to cultivate his talent for future commissions. Their travels brought them to the Hanseatic city of Reval, a key hub in the Baltic trade network. They arrived just as the St. George's Night Uprising erupted, trapping the merchant and his young apprentice far from home in a city suddenly consumed by violence and fear.

**Daily Routines:**
- Stays close to his patron for protection, rarely venturing out alone.
- When safe, he spends hours practicing his drawing, using scraps of parchment or wood to sketch faces, scenes of the city, and his own interpretations of religious figures.
- Listens intently to the mix of languages in the streets—German, Estonian, Latin—trying to make sense of the world around him.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
- **The Merchant's Protection:** Theophanes's patron, Niccolò, has been threatened. Theophanes, too young to fight, asks the player to protect his master or to retrieve a valuable item that was stolen from their lodgings.
- **A Glimmer of Beauty:** Desperate for proper materials, Theophanes asks the player to find him a small pot of egg tempera, a clean wooden panel, or a rare pigment from a ransacked church so he can create a small icon as a prayer for safety.
- **Sketches of the Damned:** He is morbidly fascinated by the conflict and wishes to sketch the combatants. He might ask the player to escort him to a safe vantage point overlooking a skirmish or to describe a key figure (a rebel leader, a knight commander) in great detail so he can capture their likeness.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Theophanes's worldview is that of a deeply devout Orthodox Christian from the heart of the Byzantine Empire. For him, art is not a form of self-expression but a sacred service, a window into the divine. He is a practitioner of the Hesychast tradition, which emphasizes that the artist, through prayer and spiritual discipline, can become a conduit for divine light and truth. His philosophy of art is one of spiritual realism; the goal is not to replicate the fallen, material world, but to reveal the transcendent, eternal reality of God, the saints, and the angels. He is described as a "philosopher and a sage," indicating a man of deep learning who sees his artistic skill as inseparable from his theological understanding.

**Major Creative Works:**
While the game places him in Reval as a youth, the historical Theophanes the Greek (c. 1340 – c. 1410) became one of the greatest icon and fresco painters in Russia, fundamentally shaping the course of Russian art. His work is known for its expressive power, dramatic use of light and shadow, and profound spiritual intensity.
-   **Frescoes of the Church of the Transfiguration on Ilin Street, Novgorod (1378):** This is his only fully documented and largely surviving monumental work. The frescoes are masterpieces of expressionistic power, with figures that are both imposing and deeply human. His depictions of saints and ascetics are particularly noted for their psychological depth and spiritual force.
-   **Iconostasis of the Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow Kremlin (c. 1405):** He collaborated with the younger master Andrei Rublev on this monumental project. The icons attributed to Theophanes, particularly those in the Deesis tier, are characterized by their dramatic intensity and bold, almost monochromatic, style.
-   **The Don Icon of the Mother of God:** While attribution is debated, this revered icon is often credited to his hand. It is a work of immense tenderness and spiritual power, a cornerstone of Russian iconography.
-   **Influence:** Theophanes's bold, expressive style, which combined Byzantine tradition with a unique, dynamic energy, had a profound and lasting impact on Russian art. He was the master and mentor to the most famous of all Russian icon painters, Andrei Rublev, thereby linking the traditions of Byzantium directly to the golden age of Russian art.

**Scenes:**
- Can be found in the lodgings of his Genoese merchant patron, Niccolò, located in the bustling `revel_north_west_quarter_merchants`.
