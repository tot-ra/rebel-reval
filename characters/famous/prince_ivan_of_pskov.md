![alt text](image-17.png)

**Visual Description:**
Prince Ivan is a seasoned warrior, likely in his 30s or 40s. He has a strong, weathered face, with a thick beard and long, dark hair tied back. His eyes are sharp and alert, accustomed to scanning battlefields and courtrooms alike. He is more a soldier than a courtier, and his attire reflects this. He would wear practical chainmail or lamellar armor, covered by a heavy cloak. Even in more formal settings, he would favor function over finery.

**Motivations:**
Ivan is motivated by the security and prosperity of the Pskov Republic. As a frequent adversary of the Livonian Order, he sees the Estonian uprising as a golden opportunity to strike a blow against his long-standing enemy. His decision to lead an army into the Bishopric of Dorpat was a calculated strategic move, not an act of altruism. He is a pragmatist, willing to aid the rebels as long as it serves Pskov's interests, but also willing to withdraw the moment the situation becomes unfavorable.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** The boyars and merchants of Pskov. He has a complex and often tense relationship with the larger Novgorod Republic, which still viewed Pskov as within its sphere of influence.
*   **Enemies:** The Livonian Order and the Bishopric of Dorpat are his primary, long-term enemies.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as representative of the rebellion's potential. If the rebels are strong and organized, they are useful allies. If they are weak and fractured, they are a lost cause. He would judge Kalev on his strength and his ability to fight, not on his personal story.

**History (Biography):**
While specific biographical details about Prince Ivan of Pskov from this exact period are scarce, he represents the leadership of the Pskov Republic, a state that was fiercely independent and frequently at odds with the Livonian Order. In 1343, the chronicles record that a Pskovian army of 5,000, led by a Prince Ivan, invaded the territory of the Bishopric of Dorpat to support the Estonian rebels. They reached Otepää but retreated after learning that the main rebellion in Harju had been crushed, highlighting the pragmatic nature of Pskov's involvement.

**Daily Routines:**
As a prince of a frontier republic, Ivan's days would be a mix of military and civic duties. He would be involved in training the militia, inspecting fortifications, and planning defenses against the Livonians. He would also preside over the *veche* (the city's assembly), settling disputes and managing the affairs of the republic.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Pskovian Army:** The player could be tasked with guiding the Pskovian army through the territory of the Bishopric of Dorpat, acting as a scout or a guide.
*   **A Faltering Alliance:** A quest could focus on the moment the Pskovians decide to retreat. The player might have to try and persuade Prince Ivan to stay and fight, or deal with the consequences of his withdrawal.
*   **Cross-Border Raid:** The player could join a Pskovian raiding party, striking at Livonian outposts and supply lines, and getting a taste of the brutal border warfare of the era.
