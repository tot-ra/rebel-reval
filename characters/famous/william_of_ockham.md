# William of Ockham

![alt text](image-9.png)

**Visual Description:**
William of Ockham is a man in his late 50s, with a sharp, ascetic face that reflects a life of intense intellectual rigor and controversy. He is thin, with a high forehead, piercing intelligent eyes, and a tonsured, greying haircut typical of a Franciscan friar. He wears the simple, coarse brown robes of his order. His demeanor is one of profound intellectual confidence and a certain weariness from his long conflict with the church authorities.

**Motivations:**
Ockham is motivated by a search for truth, both philosophical and theological. He is a radical thinker who challenged the established scholastic traditions of his time. His flight from the papal court at Avignon was motivated by his belief that the Pope had exceeded his authority and fallen into heresy. If he were in Reval, it would be as a fugitive, seeking refuge in a remote corner of Christendom where the Pope's reach was weak. He would be driven to continue his writing and philosophical work, even in hiding.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** As a fugitive, he would have few allies. He might find cautious protection from elements within the Livonian Order who were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor, Louis IV, Ockham's protector. He might also find intellectual companionship with other scholars at the Dome School, if he dared reveal himself.
*   **Enemies:** The Pope and his agents are his primary enemies. He would be a high-value target for the Inquisition. His radical ideas would also make him an enemy of the more conservative theological minds in Reval.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** Ockham would likely see Kalev as a fascinating philosophical puzzle. He might see in the simple, direct worldview of the smith a real-world application of his principle of simplicity (Ockham's Razor). He would be interested in Kalev's motivations, trying to strip away the complex layers of politics and religion to find the simplest, most direct cause of his actions.

**History (Biography):**
William of Ockham was a highly influential English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher. He is famous for the principle of parsimony known as "Ockham's Razor." In the 1320s, his writings were condemned by a papal commission, and he was forced to flee the papal court at Avignon in 1328. He sought protection with the Holy Roman Emperor, Louis IV of Bavaria, and spent the rest of his life in exile, writing treatises on logic, philosophy, and politics. While historically he spent his exile in Munich, his presence in a remote location like Reval is a fictional scenario that places a major intellectual figure in the middle of the game's raw, provincial conflict.

**Daily Routines:**
Ockham's routine would be one of secrecy and intense intellectual work. He would live in hiding, perhaps in a secluded room in a monastery or under the protection of a powerful vassal. His days would be spent reading, writing, and thinking, filling parchment with his sharp, logical arguments against the philosophical and theological status quo.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Fugitive Friar:** The player could stumble upon Ockham's hiding place and be drawn into the dangerous game of concealing him from papal agents who are hunting for him in the city.
*   **Forbidden Knowledge:** Ockham might entrust the player with smuggling his controversial manuscripts out of the city, or with acquiring rare books he needs for his work.
*   **The Razor's Edge:** The player might bring a complex moral or political problem to Ockham, who would then use his powerful intellect to cut through the confusion and reveal the simplest, and perhaps most dangerous, truth at its heart, setting the player on a new and unexpected path.
