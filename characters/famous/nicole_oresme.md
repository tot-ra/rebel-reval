# Nicole Oresme

![alt text](image-11.png)

**Visual Description:**
A young man around 20 years old, Nicole Oresme is a prodigy of astounding intellect. He has a sharp, bird-like intensity, with bright, curious eyes that dart about, taking in every detail. He is of a slight build and wears the simple, dark robes of a scholar of the College of Navarre in Paris. He is often lost in thought, with a habit of muttering complex mathematical or economic theories to himself.

**Motivations:**
Oresme is motivated by a desire to understand and explain the workings of the world, from the heavens to the economy. He is a polymath, making groundbreaking contributions in numerous fields. He might be in Reval as an advisor to the Hanseatic League, hired to write a treatise on the economic consequences of the rebellion and to advise them on how to mitigate their financial losses through currency manipulation and strategic investments. He is fascinated by the chaos, seeing it as a real-world test of his economic and social theories.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** His patrons in the Hanseatic League, who value his brilliant, if eccentric, mind. He would find intellectual companionship with the other Parisian scholars, Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony.
*   **Enemies:** His ideas about economics, particularly his condemnation of currency debasement, could make him enemies among powerful figures (perhaps even the Danish Viceroy) who might be using the crisis to enrich themselves.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as a variable in a complex equation. He would be interested in quantifying Kalev's impact on the "system" of the city. He might ask the player seemingly strange questions about the price of iron, the man-hours lost to the rebellion, and the velocity of money in the black market, all to feed his complex economic models.

**History (Biography):**
Nicole Oresme (c. 1323–1382) was a French philosopher, economist, mathematician, and physicist, and one of the most original thinkers of the 14th century. He wrote the first treatise on economics in a modern sense, *De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum*. His fictional presence in Reval as a young economic advisor to the Hanseatic League is a compelling way to introduce sophisticated economic ideas into the game's narrative.

**Daily Routines:**
Oresme's days are spent gathering data. He would be found in the market, noting prices. He would be at the harbor, counting ships and cargo. He would be in the counting houses of the Hanseatic merchants, studying their ledgers. He would then spend his nights in his study, turning this raw data into complex charts and theories about the economic lifeblood of the city.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Price of War:** Oresme hires the player to conduct economic espionage, gathering specific data on the rebels' supply lines, their sources of funding, and the economic output of the territories they control.
*   **Gresham's Law:** Oresme discovers that a powerful figure is debasing the city's currency for personal profit, causing economic chaos. He asks the player to help him expose the counterfeiter, a dangerous task that could upset the city's power balance.
*   **An Economic Prophecy:** Based on his models, Oresme makes a startling prediction about the long-term economic consequences of the rebellion—a prediction that, if revealed, could cause a panic or a shift in allegiances. The player must decide what to do with this powerful information.
