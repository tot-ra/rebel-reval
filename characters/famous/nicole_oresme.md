**Visual Description:**
A young man around 20 years old, Nicole Oresme is a prodigy of astounding intellect. He has a sharp, bird-like intensity, with bright, curious eyes that dart about, taking in every detail. He is of a slight build and wears the simple, dark robes of a scholar of the College of Navarre in Paris. He is often lost in thought, with a habit of muttering complex mathematical or economic theories to himself.

**Motivations:**
Oresme is motivated by a desire to understand and explain the workings of the world, from the heavens to the economy. He is a polymath, making groundbreaking contributions in numerous fields. He might be in Reval as an advisor to the Hanseatic League, hired to write a treatise on the economic consequences of the rebellion and to advise them on how to mitigate their financial losses through currency manipulation and strategic investments. He is fascinated by the chaos, seeing it as a real-world test of his economic and social theories.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** His patrons in the Hanseatic League, who value his brilliant, if eccentric, mind. He would find intellectual companionship with the other Parisian scholars, Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony.
*   **Enemies:** His ideas about economics, particularly his condemnation of currency debasement, could make him enemies among powerful figures (perhaps even the Danish Viceroy) who might be using the crisis to enrich themselves.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as a variable in a complex equation. He would be interested in quantifying Kalev's impact on the "system" of the city. He might ask the player seemingly strange questions about the price of iron, the man-hours lost to the rebellion, and the velocity of money in the black market, all to feed his complex economic models.

**History (Biography):**
Nicole Oresme (c. 1323–1382) was a French philosopher, economist, mathematician, and physicist, and one of the most original thinkers of the 14th century. He wrote the first treatise on economics in a modern sense, *De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum*. His fictional presence in Reval as a young economic advisor to the Hanseatic League is a compelling way to introduce sophisticated economic ideas into the game's narrative.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **[St. Olaf's Guild Hall](../../scenes/revel_north_west_quarter_merchants/st_olafs_guild_hall.md):** He would have a study here, provided by his Hanseatic patrons, where he analyzes the data he has collected.
*   **[Reval Market](../../scenes/revel_central_quarter/market_civic_quarter/market.md):** Can be found meticulously recording the prices of goods, the flow of currency, and the volume of trade.
*   **[Reval Harbor](../../scenes/revel_north_oleviste/harbor.md):** He would spend time here observing the cargo of incoming and outgoing ships, a key indicator of the city's economic health.

**Daily Routines:**
Oresme's days are spent gathering data. He would be found in the market, noting prices. He would be at the harbor, counting ships and cargo. He would be in the counting houses of the Hanseatic merchants, studying their ledgers. He would then spend his nights in his study, turning this raw data into complex charts and theories about the economic lifeblood of the city.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Price of War:** Oresme hires the player to conduct economic espionage, gathering specific data on the rebels' supply lines, their sources of funding, and the economic output of the territories they control.
*   **Gresham's Law:** Oresme discovers that a powerful figure is debasing the city's currency for personal profit, causing economic chaos. He asks the player to help him expose the counterfeiter, a dangerous task that could upset the city's power balance.
*   **An Economic Prophecy:** Based on his models, Oresme makes a startling prediction about the long-term economic consequences of the rebellion—a prediction that, if revealed, could cause a panic or a shift in allegiances. The player must decide what to do with this powerful information.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Nicole Oresme is a towering intellect of the late Middle Ages, a man whose worldview stands at the threshold of the modern era. His philosophy is one of radical rationalism and mathematical analysis. He sees the universe as a vast, complex, but ultimately understandable system governed by mathematical laws—a great "clockwork" set in motion by God. He is a pioneer in applying quantitative and graphical methods to problems that were previously only discussed in qualitative terms. He believes that everything, from the quality of heat to the velocity of a moving object, can be represented and analyzed geometrically. While a devout churchman, he is a fierce opponent of superstition, writing influential treatises against astrology and magic. He argues for a naturalistic explanation of phenomena, suggesting, for example, that the Earth could rotate on its axis without contradicting scripture. His worldview is one of order, reason, and the power of the human mind to comprehend the intricate machinery of God's creation.

**Major Creative Works:**
Oresme was a polymath whose works were groundbreaking in multiple fields. He was a crucial figure in translating complex ideas from Latin into the French vernacular, making them accessible to a wider audience.
-   ***De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum*** **(Treatise on the Origin, Nature, Law, and Alterations of Money):** This is one of the most important economic works of the Middle Ages. In it, Oresme argues that money belongs to the community, not to the prince, and that the ruler has a moral and practical obligation to maintain its integrity. He condemns the practice of debasement (reducing the precious metal content of coins) as a form of theft and a grave danger to the economic health of the realm. His work contains an early formulation of what would later be called "Gresham's Law" (that bad money drives good money out of circulation).
-   ***Livre du ciel et du monde*** **(Book of the Heavens and the World):** In this commentary on Aristotle, written in French for the king, Oresme made some of his most startling scientific arguments. He argued that there was no rational proof that the Earth is stationary and that it is more logical to assume the Earth rotates daily than that the entire sphere of the fixed stars revolves around it. While he ultimately concluded that he believed in a stationary Earth as a matter of faith, his arguments provided a crucial foundation for Copernicus two centuries later.
-   ***Tractatus de configuratione qualitatum et motuum*** **(Treatise on the Configuration of Qualities and Motions):** This is his most important contribution to mathematics and physics. In this work, he developed a system for representing variable quantities using geometric figures—essentially inventing a form of coordinate geometry before Descartes. He used this graphical system to analyze concepts like velocity and acceleration, and he was the first to prove the "Merton mean speed theorem," a key kinematic law for uniformly accelerated motion, which was crucial to Galileo's later work on falling bodies.
-   **Translations:** At the behest of King Charles V of France, he translated many of Aristotle's major works (such as the *Ethics*, *Politics*, and *On the Heavens*) into French for the first time, coining many new French scientific terms in the process and laying the groundwork for a French intellectual tradition outside of Latin.
