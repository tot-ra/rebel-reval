# Valdemar IV Atterdag

![alt text](image-10.png)

**Visual Description:**
A man in his early twenties, Valdemar IV possesses a lean, wiry build that speaks of a life of constant activity rather than courtly leisure. His hair is a deep brown, nearly black, medium in length and often unkempt from travel and the wearing of helmets. His eyes are a sharp, intelligent blue, holding a calculating gaze that misses little. He is dressed in rich, dark velvet, the deep crimson of his tunic a stark contrast to the polished black leather of his high boots. A heavy, gold-buckled belt sits low on his hips, a sign of his noble status. He is clean-shaven, revealing a determined jawline.

**Motivations:**
Valdemar's singular motivation is the restoration of the Kingdom of Denmark. In the summer of 1342, he is personally present in Reval to oversee the final, delicate negotiations for the sale of the Duchy of Estonia to the Teutonic Order. Every coin from this sale is destined to redeem pawned Danish lands. He is driven by a fierce, pragmatic ambition, viewing the growing unrest among the Estonian peasantry as a mere annoyance that could complicate the sale, but nothing the Livonian Order can't handle. He sees Estonia not as a land and a people, but as a chess piece and a source of revenue, and his presence is a closely guarded secret to avoid alarming the Swedes or other regional powers.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** Nominally, the German vassals in Estonia are his subjects, but he views them with suspicion. His true allies are those who can help him financially or militarily back in Denmark.
*   **Enemies:** The Livonian Order is a rival for power in the region. The Estonian rebels are a nuisance that threatens the value of his asset (Estonia). He also has numerous political enemies among the German princes holding parts of Denmark.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would not know or care about a single smith. To him, Kalev is just another face in the rebellious Estonian mob, an obstacle to the profitable sale of the duchy.

**History (Biography):**
Born around 1320, likely at SÃ¸nderborg Castle, Valdemar IV, known as "Atterdag" (Day's Return), ascended to the throne of a fragmented and bankrupt Denmark in 1340. By 1342, he has spent two years tirelessly working to reassemble his kingdom. His journey to Reval was a high-stakes gamble, a secret trip by sea under the guise of a diplomatic mission to Sweden, to ensure the profitable sale of the duchy. The heavy taxes he imposed were a calculated risk to squeeze the last revenues from the territory, a decision that is now fueling the very rebellion that threatens to undermine his plans. The St. George's Night Uprising of 1343 would become the dangerous complication he failed to foresee, but in the summer of 1342, he is a king playing a dangerous game of chess, confident he is in control.

**Faction Views:**
*   **The Livonian Order:** A necessary evil. He needs their military strength to control the Estonian peasants and their financial resources to buy the duchy, but he sees them as arrogant, untrustworthy rivals who have long undermined Danish authority.
*   **The Hanseatic League:** A source of frustration and income. He resents their power and autonomy but knows he cannot afford to alienate them. He sees them as greedy merchants to be taxed and managed.
*   **The Estonian Rebels:** A nuisance. He views them not as a people with legitimate grievances, but as a pest infestation that threatens the value of his property. He has no interest in their culture or their plight, only in their swift and brutal suppression.
*   **The Swedish Crown:** A dangerous rival. He is deeply suspicious of Swedish ambitions in the Baltic and his secret trip to Reval is partly designed to prevent them from interfering in the sale of Estonia.
*   **The Grand Duchy of Lithuania:** A distant, pagan threat. He knows of them primarily as an enemy of the Order, and as long as they keep the knights busy, he is content to ignore them.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **[Toompea Castle](../../scenes/revel_toompea/domberg/domberg.md):** Can be found in the most secure chambers of the castle, conducting secret negotiations with his viceroy and emissaries from the Livonian Order.
*   **[The Cathedral of Saint Mary](../../scenes/revel_toompea/cathedral_of_saint_mary/cathedral_of_saint_mary.md):** Might attend a private mass here, a public display of piety that masks his purely political machinations.
*   **[Reval Harbor](../../scenes/revel_north_oleviste/harbor.md):** Could make a secret, late-night visit to the harbor to oversee the loading of tax revenues onto a ship bound for Denmark.

**Daily Routines:**
As a king constantly on the move, Valdemar has no fixed routine. His days are filled with travel, negotiations, planning military campaigns, and managing the complex finances of his kingdom. When in a place like Reval, he would likely be found in Toompea Castle, poring over maps and ledgers, or meeting with his viceroy and vassals.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The King's Tax:** The player could be involved in either collecting or resisting Valdemar's oppressive taxes, leading to direct or indirect conflict with the king's agents.
*   **A Secret Sale:** The player might uncover evidence of Valdemar's secret negotiations to sell Estonia, creating a moral dilemma: expose the king and risk chaos, or use the information for personal or factional gain.
*   **An Audience with the King:** A high-level quest could involve the player needing to gain an audience with Valdemar himself, perhaps to plead a case, deliver a warning, or even make a threat.
