**Visual Description:**
In his early 40s, Thomas Bradwardine possesses the sharp, focused features of a man consumed by intellectual pursuits. He is tall and lanky, with a tendency to stoop as if perpetually leaning over a book or diagram. His brown hair is receding at the temples, and he is clean-shaven, revealing a firm jaw and a thoughtful mouth. His eyes are a clear, piercing blue, quick to light up with intellectual fervor or narrow in intense concentration. He wears the simple, dark robes of an Oxford scholar and theologian, practical and unadorned. His fingers are long, slender, and often smudged with ink. He exudes an aura of restless intelligence, his mind always working, calculating, and analyzing the world around him.

**Motivations:**
- To understand the world through the lens of logic and mathematics, believing them to be the language of God.
- To apply his theories of motion and kinematics to the practical problems of the world, from the trajectory of a catapult stone to the movement of armies.
- To find a logical, theological explanation for the chaos and violence of the uprising, seeing it as a complex equation to be solved.

**Ties & Relationships:**
- **Allies:** He would seek out the company of other learned men, particularly mathematicians, engineers, and military strategists. He would be fascinated by the siege engines and fortifications of the city and would eagerly debate with anyone who could appreciate the beauty of a well-reasoned argument.
- **Enemies:** He has little patience for superstition, irrationality, or arguments based on emotion rather than logic. He would clash with mystical thinkers, dogmatic clergy who reject science, and anyone who acts without a clear, calculated purpose.
- **Initial view of the main player:** He would see the player as a variable in a complex system. He would be fascinated by the player's ability to influence events, studying their choices and outcomes as a scientist studies a natural phenomenon, perhaps offering advice based on calculated probabilities of success.

**History (Biography):**
Thomas Bradwardine is a leading mind of his generation, a prominent English mathematician, philosopher, and theologian from Merton College, Oxford. As a key member of the Oxford Calculators, he is at the forefront of developing a new, mathematical approach to physics and philosophy. His work on the mean speed theorem is a foundational concept in the study of kinematics, predating Galileo by centuries. A true polymath, he is also a respected theologian, serving as a chaplain to King Edward III. He was traveling to the papal court at Avignon on a diplomatic mission, but his ship was blown far off course by a storm and damaged, forcing it to seek refuge and repairs in the port of Reval. The outbreak of the rebellion has left this brilliant mind stranded, a man of logic in a world suddenly gone mad.

**Daily Routines:**
- Spends hours in deep thought, often pacing back and forth, working through complex equations in his head or scratching them onto any available surface.
- If given the opportunity, he will study the city's defenses, the mechanics of its gates and walls, and the trajectories of arrows fired from the ramparts, making endless calculations.
- Engages in rigorous debate, challenging the assumptions of others and defending his own conclusions with formidable logic.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
- **The Logic of Siege:** Bradwardine has calculated a critical flaw in the rebels' siege tactics (or the Order's defensive formation). He needs the player to deliver a message containing his complex calculations to the correct commander, a task that requires navigating a dangerous and chaotic battlefield.
- **The Unmoved Mover:** He has lost his personal copy of Aristotle's *Physics*, a book essential to his work. He asks the player to retrieve it from his storm-damaged ship, which is now beached in a vulnerable area outside the city walls.
- **A Calculated Risk:** Bradwardine has devised a plan to achieve a specific objective (e.g., rescue a captive, retrieve a supply cache) with the highest probability of success and minimal casualties. He presents his plan to the player, asking them to execute it precisely as calculated, testing his theories in the crucible of real-world conflict.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Thomas Bradwardine is a towering figure of the 14th-century intellectual world, a man whose worldview is a unique synthesis of mathematical rigor and profound theological conviction. As a leading member of the "Oxford Calculators," his philosophy is grounded in the belief that the universe is fundamentally mathematical and that the study of natural philosophy is a path to understanding God. He is a determinist, arguing in his theological masterpiece that God's will is the primary cause of all things and that human free will operates only within the bounds of divine predetermination. He sees the world as a logical, ordered system, and he applies the new mathematical tools of kinematics and the study of proportions to everything from the motion of a falling stone to the nature of God's grace. He is a man who sees the mind of God as that of a master geometer, and his life's work is to decipher the divine equations that govern both the physical and the spiritual realms.

**Major Creative Works:**
Bradwardine was a polymath whose works were foundational in both science and theology.
-   ***De Causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum*** **(The Cause of God against Pelagius and on the Power of Causes):** This is his theological magnum opus. It is a vast and complex work of scholastic theology that argues for the necessity of divine grace and God's absolute sovereignty over all creation. It is a landmark of theological determinism and showcases his method of treating theological problems with mathematical precision.
-   ***Tractatus de proportionibus velocitatum in motibus*** **(Treatise on the Proportions of Velocities in Motions):** Written in 1328, this was a revolutionary work of physics and mathematics. In it, Bradwardine proposed a new mathematical law to describe the relationship between a body's speed, the force moving it, and the resistance it encounters. This was a crucial step away from Aristotle and towards a truly mathematical physics, and it was highly influential on later thinkers like Nicole Oresme.
-   **The Mean Speed Theorem:** As one of the Oxford Calculators, Bradwardine is credited with being one of the first to formulate this crucial theorem of kinematics. The theorem states that a body moving with constant acceleration travels the same distance in a given time as a body moving at a constant speed equal to the average of the initial and final speeds. This theorem, also known as the "Merton Rule," is a cornerstone of the physics of motion and was used by Galileo in his study of falling bodies 250 years later.
-   **Speculative Mathematics:** He wrote several influential treatises on "speculative" mathematics, including *De Geometria speculativa* and *De Arithmetica practica*. These works explored the philosophical and logical foundations of mathematics and were widely studied in European universities.
-   **Works on Logic:** He also made significant contributions to logic, particularly in the study of logical paradoxes, with his treatise *De insolubilibus*.

**Scenes:**
- Can be found poring over manuscripts in the library of the Dome School or observing the city's fortifications from the upper walls of `revel_toompea`.
