# Richard Rolle

![alt text](image-18.png)

**Visual Description:**
A man in his early 40s, Richard Rolle has the gaunt, wild-eyed appearance of a true ascetic. He is thin to the point of emaciation, with a long, unkempt beard and piercing eyes that seem to be looking at something beyond the material world. He wears the simple, rough-spun robes of a hermit, patched and weathered from years of living in the wilderness. He is a figure of intense, almost unsettling, spiritual energy.

**Motivations:**
Rolle is motivated by a profound, all-consuming love for God. He is a mystic who seeks a direct, personal union with the divine through a life of extreme asceticism, contemplation, and prayer. He has traveled to the remote, untamed wilderness of Estonia to escape the distractions of the world and to find a place where he can feel closer to God's creation. He is indifferent to the political conflict, seeing it as a foolish and worldly distraction from the true battle for the human soul.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** He has no allies in the traditional sense. He might be seen as a holy man by some of the common folk, both Estonian and German, who might leave him offerings of food.
*   **Enemies:** His unconventional, personal brand of mysticism could be viewed as heretical by the more dogmatic elements of the Church. The pagan Cult of Metsik might see him as a strange and unpredictable rival for the spiritual soul of the forest.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev not as a rebel or a smith, but as a soul in turmoil. He would speak to Kalev in cryptic, poetic language, urging him to abandon his worldly struggles and seek the "fire of love" that Rolle himself experiences. He would be a source of strange, unsolicited, and perhaps profound spiritual advice.

**History (Biography):**
Richard Rolle (c. 1300–1349) was an English religious writer, mystic, and hermit. His writings were widely read in the 14th and 15th centuries. He lived a life of extreme asceticism, and his works describe his mystical experiences of union with God. His presence in Estonia is entirely fictional, but it is plausible that a man seeking the ultimate solitude to pursue his spiritual quest would be drawn to the vast, sparsely populated forests of the Baltic.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **A Secluded Hermitage:** His primary location is a crude, self-built hut or a cave deep in the forests, far from any road or settlement. This location would not be marked on any map and would have to be discovered through exploration or rumors.
*   **[The Sacred Grove](../../scenes/world/sacred_grove.md):** He might be drawn to the spiritual power of such a place, not to worship the old gods, but to feel the presence of his own God in the raw, untamed nature.
*   **Near a remote village:** Occasionally, he might be seen on the outskirts of a small, isolated village, silently observing the lives of the peasants before retreating back into his solitude.

**Daily Routines:**
Rolle's days are a simple cycle of prayer, meditation, and subsistence. He would live in a crude hut or a cave deep in the forest, far from any settlement. He would spend his hours in ecstatic contemplation, writing his mystical treatises on scraps of parchment, and foraging for the bare minimum of food to survive.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Mad Hermit:** The player is sent to investigate reports of a "mad hermit" in the woods whose strange preaching is unsettling the local peasants. This leads to an encounter with Rolle and a glimpse into his mystical world.
*   **The Mystic's Vision:** Rolle has a powerful, prophetic vision related to the uprising, but it is couched in cryptic, symbolic language. The player must try to decipher the vision's meaning before it's too late.
*   **The Heretic Hunt:** A zealous priest from the Order decides that Rolle is a heretic and sends soldiers to arrest him. The player must choose whether to protect the harmless mystic or to stand aside.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Richard Rolle is a central figure in the English mystical tradition. His worldview is one of intense, personal, and affective piety. He believes that the ultimate goal of human life is a direct, experiential union with God, a state that can be achieved in this life through contemplation, asceticism, and the cultivation of an all-consuming "fire of love" for the divine. His philosophy is deeply individualistic and anti-institutional; after leaving Oxford University, he rejected the structured life of a monastery for the solitary freedom of a hermit, believing that the path to God was a personal journey, not a corporate one. He describes his mystical experiences in sensual, physical terms—as a feeling of "heat, sweetness, and song" in the soul. This emphasis on personal, emotional experience over scholastic, intellectual theology makes him a radical and influential figure.

**Major Creative Works:**
Richard Rolle was a prolific writer in both Latin and, significantly, in his native Middle English, making him one of the first major English spiritual writers. His works were immensely popular and circulated widely in manuscript form.
-   ***Incendium Amoris*** **(The Fire of Love):** Written in Latin, this is his most famous work. It is a spiritual autobiography and a guide to the contemplative life, in which he describes his mystical journey and the three stages he experienced: a physical warmth in his chest (*calor*), a spiritual sweetness in his soul (*dulcor*), and a celestial music he could hear (*canor*). It is a foundational text of affective mysticism.
-   ***The Mending of Life*** **(or *Emendatio Vitae*):** A practical guide to the spiritual life, written for those seeking to turn from a life of sin to one of contemplation and love for God. It was written in both Latin and English and was one of his most widely read works.
-   ***The Form of Living***: An influential pastoral letter written in Middle English for a young female recluse named Margaret Kirkby. It provides guidance on the solitary and contemplative life and is a key example of his role as a spiritual director.
-   **English Psalter:** He wrote a popular and influential translation and commentary on the Book of Psalms in Middle English, making the psalms accessible to a lay audience that could not read Latin.
