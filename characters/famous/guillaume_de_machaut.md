# Guillaume de Machaut
![alt text](image-13.png)

**Visual Description:**
A man in his early 40s, Guillaume de Machaut has the refined and slightly world-weary appearance of a court artist. He is of medium build, with intelligent, perceptive eyes and a neatly trimmed beard. He dresses in the elegant, fashionable style of the French court, his clothes made of fine wools in rich colors, perhaps with subtle embroidery. His hands are expressive, with the long, nimble fingers of a master musician. He carries himself with a quiet dignity, a man accustomed to the complex politics of noble patronage.

**Motivations:**
Machaut is motivated by art and patronage. As one of the most famous composers and poets of his age, his life is a constant search for noble patrons who can fund his work and appreciate his genius. He might be in Reval as part of a diplomatic mission from a French or Bohemian noble, or perhaps he is exploring the possibility of finding a new patron in the wealthy, if culturally barren, lands of the Livonian Order. He seeks to create beauty and order through his music, a stark contrast to the chaos erupting around him.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** He would seek out the most powerful and cultured individuals in the city, such as the Danish Viceroy or high-ranking members of the Livonian Order, hoping to impress them with his talent.
*   **Enemies:** He has no enemies, but his refined, foreign manners and expensive clothes could make him a target for street toughs or resentful rebels.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would likely see Kalev as a rustic curiosity, a figure from a ballad or a folk song. He might be interested in the raw, untamed music of the Estonian people, seeing it as a primitive but powerful source of inspiration for his own more complex compositions.

**History (Biography):**
Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300â€“1377) was a French poet and composer, a central figure of the *Ars Nova* musical movement. He worked for a series of powerful patrons, including John I, King of Bohemia. He was a well-traveled man of the world. His fictional presence in Reval is a stretch, but it can be justified as a diplomatic or artistic mission to a remote but politically significant outpost of European nobility.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **[Toompea Castle](../../scenes/revel_toompea/domberg/domberg.md):** As a guest of the Danish Viceroy, he could be found in the castle's great hall, performing for the nobles and high-ranking knights.
*   **[The Cathedral of Saint Mary](../../scenes/revel_toompea/cathedral_of_saint_mary/cathedral_of_saint_mary.md):** He might be working with the cathedral choir, attempting to teach them his complex polyphonic compositions.
*   **[Great Guild Hall](../../scenes/reval_north/great_guild_hall.md):** Could be commissioned by the wealthy Hanseatic merchants to perform at one of their lavish feasts.

**Daily Routines:**
Machaut's days are dedicated to his art. He would spend his time composing music and poetry, practicing his instruments (such as the lute or the viol), and perhaps attempting to train a local church choir in the complex polyphonic style of the *Ars Nova*. He would be a man apart, trying to create a small island of high culture in a sea of conflict.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Lost Motet:** A complex piece of music Machaut has written for a potential patron has been stolen or lost in the chaos of the city. The player must retrieve the precious manuscript before it is destroyed.
*   **A Song for a Siege:** Machaut is commissioned to write a piece of music to raise the morale of the city's defenders. He asks the player to take him to various locations around the city so he can find the right inspiration, exposing him to both the horrors and the heroism of the conflict.
*   **The Devil's Music:** A conservative cleric denounces Machaut's complex, polyphonic music as decadent and sinful. The player must protect the composer from the wrath of a mob of religious fanatics.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Machaut's artistic philosophy is grounded in the idea that music, rhetoric, and reason are not learned sciences but innate, "natural gifts." He sees the artist as a creator akin to Nature itself, one who channels these gifts to bring order and beauty into the world. As a man who has served kings and traveled widely, his worldview is cosmopolitan and sophisticated. He is a master of the intricate rules of courtly love, which form the thematic core of his secular work, but he is equally adept at conveying the spiritual solemnity of the sacred. He represents the pinnacle of the medieval ideal of the poet-composer, where text and music are inextricably linked, each enhancing the meaning and emotional power of the other.

**Major Creative Works:**
Guillaume de Machaut was the leading figure of the French *Ars Nova*, a musical movement that revolutionized rhythmic and harmonic complexity. He was a prolific creator in both sacred and secular genres.
-   ***Messe de Nostre Dame*** **(Mass of Our Lady):** Composed in the early 1360s, this is his most famous and historically significant work. It is the first complete polyphonic setting of the Mass Ordinary (the parts of the liturgy that do not change) to be composed by a single person. Its four-voice texture and rhythmic complexity were groundbreaking and established the Mass as a major genre for musical composition for centuries to come.
-   **Secular Songs (Ballades, Rondeaux, Virelais):** Machaut composed over a hundred secular songs, which are considered the definitive examples of their forms. These pieces, often dealing with themes of courtly love, showcase his lyrical genius and his ability to weave intricate vocal lines into a coherent and expressive whole.
-   ***Le Livre dou Voir Dit*** **(The Book of the True Poem):** This long narrative poem is a semi-autobiographical account of a late-in-life love affair between the aging poet and a young noblewoman. It is a remarkable work of psychological introspection and formal innovation, embedding lyric poems and musical compositions directly into the narrative. It stands as one of the great literary achievements of the 14th century.
