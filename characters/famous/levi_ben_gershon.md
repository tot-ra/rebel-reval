![alt text](image-23.png)

**Visual Description:**
At 55, Levi ben Gershon is a man in the autumn of his years, but his mind remains as sharp as a winter frost. He is of medium height, with a slender, scholarly build. His beard is long, white, and meticulously kept, a sign of his rabbinic learning. His dark eyes, framed by wrinkles, hold a deep, penetrating intelligence, accustomed to scrutinizing both the heavens and ancient texts. He wears the distinctive, modest clothing of a French Jewish scholar: a simple, dark-colored woolen robe, a small cap on his head, and well-worn leather shoes. He carries a satchel filled with books, astronomical charts, and writing implements. His posture is slightly stooped from a lifetime spent hunched over manuscripts.

**Motivations:**
- To complete his philosophical and astronomical works, seeking to reconcile faith with Aristotelian reason.
- To find a safe haven for his community in a time of increasing persecution.
- To observe the current conflict with a philosopher's eye, seeing it as a case study in human nature, politics, and divine will.

**Ties & Relationships:**
- **Allies:** He would seek out other scholars, regardless of their faith, engaging in debates with the theologians of the Dome School or any learned men he could find. He would also be a natural leader and advisor to any Jewish merchants or families in Reval.
- **Enemies:** As a prominent Jewish figure, he would be a target for religious extremists on all sides. He would be deeply distrustful of fanatics, whether they be pagan rebels or zealous crusading knights.
- **Initial view of the main player:** He would be cautious but deeply curious. He would analyze the player's actions, not in terms of good or evil, but in terms of their logical consequences and underlying motivations, perhaps offering cryptic but insightful advice.

**History (Biography):**
Levi ben Gershon, known to the Latin world as Gersonides, is one of the most important Jewish thinkers of the Middle Ages. A polymath from the south of France, he is a renowned philosopher, Talmudist, mathematician, and astronomer. His magnum opus, *The Wars of the Lord*, is a bold attempt to synthesize religious scripture with the philosophical reasoning of Aristotle. He also invented the Jacob's staff, an instrument used to measure the angular distance between celestial objects, making significant contributions to astronomy. He was traveling to meet with a small but learned Jewish community in the East, a journey funded by a patron who wished for him to consult on a series of ancient texts. His route took him through the Baltic, and he was visiting the small Jewish quarter in Reval when the uprising began, trapping him in the city.

**Daily Routines:**
- Spends much of his day in study and prayer, whether in a secluded room or a quiet corner of a synagogue.
- Engages in rigorous intellectual debate with anyone willing and able to hold a conversation on matters of philosophy, science, or theology.
- At night, if the sky is clear and it is safe, he will attempt to make astronomical observations, charting the stars from this new, northern latitude.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
- **The Lost Texts:** A satchel containing a crucial section of his latest philosophical treatise was lost during the initial chaos. He asks the player to retrieve it from a dangerous, rebel-held part of the city.
- **An Instrument of the Heavens:** His Jacob's staff was damaged. He needs the player to find a skilled woodworker to repair it and to acquire a rare, clear piece of glass for a lens he is grinding, a task that might lead the player to the city's finest artisans.
- **A Debate of Faith and Reason:** A prominent and dogmatic clergyman in the city has publicly denounced Gersonides's work as heresy. He asks the player not to silence the man with violence, but to act as a neutral mediator and guard for a public debate, ensuring that the contest of ideas is won with words, not swords.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Levi ben Gershon is a towering figure of medieval Jewish rationalism, a philosopher who believes that faith and reason are not enemies but two paths to the same divine truth. His worldview is a bold synthesis of Jewish scripture, Talmudic law, and the rigorous logic of Aristotelian philosophy. He holds that the universe is a rational, ordered system, and that by studying the natural world through science and mathematics, one is in fact studying the wisdom of God's creation. He is a controversial figure because he is unafraid to follow reason wherever it leads, even when it challenges traditional religious dogma. He rejects the idea of creation from nothing (*ex nihilo*), arguing instead that God created the universe out of a pre-existing formless matter, a position closer to Plato than to mainstream rabbinic thought. For Gersonides, the pursuit of knowledge through science is not merely a secular activity but a sacred duty, the highest form of human endeavor.

**Major Creative Works:**
Gersonides was a true polymath, whose works made significant and often controversial contributions to philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and biblical studies.
-   ***Milhamot HaShem*** **(The Wars of the Lord):** This is his philosophical masterpiece, one of the most important and audacious works of medieval Jewish thought. Written over many years, it is a systematic attempt to address the most profound questions where faith and reason seem to conflict, such as the nature of prophecy, divine providence, human free will, and the creation of the universe. His rationalist conclusions were so controversial that his critics mockingly called the book "The Wars Against the Lord."
-   **Biblical Commentaries:** He wrote extensive commentaries on many books of the Bible, from the Pentateuch to the Song of Songs. These commentaries are notable for their philosophical depth, seeking to find the rational and ethical lessons within the sacred texts.
-   **Astronomical and Mathematical Works:** Gersonides was a practicing astronomer of the first rank. His astronomical work, particularly his book on the subject which was later translated into Latin, was highly respected for its observational accuracy. He was a sharp critic of the Ptolemaic system's flaws, and his observations of eclipses and planetary positions were among the most advanced of his time.
-   **The Jacob's Staff:** He is credited with the invention of this navigational and astronomical instrument. The Jacob's staff was a simple but effective tool that allowed sailors and astronomers to measure the angle between two celestial bodies (like the moon and a star), making it a crucial piece of technology for the Age of Discovery that would follow a century later.
-   ***De Sinibus, Chordis et Arcubus*** **(On Sines, Chords and Arcs):** A mathematical treatise that demonstrates his mastery of trigonometry, which was essential for his astronomical calculations.

**Scenes:**
- Can be found in a secluded rented room that serves as a makeshift study and synagogue, located in the `revel_central_quarter`.
