# Goytan
![alt text](image-5.png)
**Visual Description:**
Goytan is a man in his 40s, with a quiet and observant demeanor. He has a long, thin face, a neatly trimmed brown beard, and deep-set, thoughtful eyes. His hands are calloused and stained with pigments from his work. He wears the simple, practical robes of a traveling artisan from Novgorod, perhaps of dark, undyed wool. He carries a satchel with his precious brushes, pigments, and wooden panels. He moves with a deliberate slowness, as if constantly studying the play of light and shadow on the world around him.

**Motivations:**
Goytan is motivated by his faith and his art. He is a devout Orthodox Christian who believes his talent for painting icons is a gift from God. He is driven to create images that will inspire piety and devotion. He might have traveled to Reval for a specific commission, perhaps from a wealthy Novgorodian merchant living in the city, or to study the strange Catholic art of the Germans. He is a man of peace, caught in a city on the brink of war, and his primary goal is to complete his work and return home safely.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** His patron, likely a Novgorodian merchant in Reval. He would find some kinship with the local clergy, despite the schism between the Catholic and Orthodox churches, through their shared faith.
*   **Enemies:** He has no personal enemies, but the rising tide of anti-foreign sentiment and the violence of the rebellion would pose a grave danger to him. To the more zealous knights of the Livonian Order, his Orthodox faith might be seen as heretical.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev with a mixture of fear and artistic curiosity. He would be frightened by the violence Kalev represents, but also fascinated by his face, seeing in it the raw, earthy strength of the Estonian peopleâ€”a face worthy of being painted, perhaps as a martyr or a saint.

**History (Biography):**
Goytan is mentioned in Russian chronicles as an icon painter active around 1345, working under the patronage of Semyon the Proud, the Grand Prince of Moscow. While there is no record of him visiting Reval, it was common for artisans, particularly those of high skill, to travel for commissions. The strong trade links between Reval and the Russian republics of Novgorod and Pskov make it plausible that a painter like Goytan could have been working in the city, perhaps for the small community of Orthodox merchants.

**Daily Routines:**
Goytan's days are spent in quiet contemplation and meticulous work. He would have a small workshop, perhaps in the home of his patron, where he would grind his own pigments, prepare his wooden panels with gesso, and painstakingly apply layer after layer of egg tempera. His life is one of prayer, fasting, and the slow, meditative process of creating a sacred image.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Sacred Pigments:** A quest could involve the player helping Goytan acquire rare and valuable pigments for his work, some of which might only be found in dangerous or forbidden places.
*   **An Icon of Peace:** Goytan might ask the player to help him create an icon that he believes could bring peace to the city, requiring the player to protect him and his work from the escalating violence.
*   **The Heretic Painter:** The player might have to protect Goytan from the suspicion of the Livonian Order, who may see his Orthodox icons as a form of blasphemy or a symbol of Russian influence.
