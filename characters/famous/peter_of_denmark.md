# Peter of Denmark

![alt text](../../skills/image-8.png)

**Visual Description:**
Peter is a young man, perhaps in his late 20s, with the pale complexion of a scholar who spends most of his time indoors or awake at night. He has light blond hair, often messy, and bright, inquisitive blue eyes. He is thin and slightly stooped from years of leaning over books and charts. He wears the simple, dark robes of a university scholar, practical for work and travel. He might be seen carrying a brass astrolabe or a rolled-up parchment star chart, his most prized possessions.

**Motivations:**
Peter is driven by a profound desire to understand the heavens. He is a man of science, fascinated by the mathematical precision of the cosmos. He believes that by observing the stars and planets, he can understand the mind of God. He might be in Reval for a specific astronomical event, such as a comet or an eclipse, or perhaps he has been sent to the Dome School to teach or to establish a proper observatory. The political turmoil of the city is a frustrating distraction from his celestial studies.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** The clergy and scholars associated with the Dome School in Reval would be his natural colleagues. As a Dane, he would have some standing with the Danish administration in Toompea Castle, though they might view his work as esoteric and impractical.
*   **Enemies:** He has no enemies, but his scientific pursuits could be viewed with suspicion by the more superstitious elements of society. The pagan rebels might see his stargazing as a form of foreign magic, while the more dogmatic members of the church might worry his studies could stray into forbidden astrology.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would likely ignore Kalev at first. However, he might become interested in the smith's practical knowledge of metals for building his instruments, or perhaps he would see the rebellion through a detached, almost academic lens, as a predictable conjunction of social forces, like planets in alignment.

**History (Biography):**
Peter of Denmark was a real 14th-century Danish mathematician and astronomer, known for his work on astronomical instruments. While his exact dates are uncertain, he was active in the mid-14th century. His presence in Reval is fictional but highly plausible. As a Danish scholar, he could easily have been sent to the Duchy of Estonia to work at the well-regarded Dome School, which had been established in the 13th century and was the center of learning in the region.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **[Dome School (Toompea Kool)](../../scenes/revel_toompea/dome_school/dome_school.md):** His primary location for teaching and calculations during the day.
*   **[City Walls](../../scenes/revel_walls_towers/):** At night, he can be found in one of the high towers on the city wall, using it as a makeshift observatory to study the stars.
*   **[Toompea Castle](../../scenes/revel_toompea/domberg/domberg.md):** He might be occasionally summoned to the castle to provide astrological readings for the Danish Viceroy or other high-ranking nobles.

**Daily Routines:**
Peter's routine is dictated by the stars. He would spend his nights on the walls of Toompea or in a high tower, meticulously recording the positions of stars and planets. His days would be spent in a study, performing complex calculations, drawing star charts, and perhaps teaching students. He would be a man out of sync with the rest of the city, sleeping while others work and working while others sleep.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Fallen Star:** A meteorite has fallen in a remote, dangerous location. Peter believes it is a piece of the heavens and hires the player to guide and protect him on a perilous expedition to retrieve it.
*   **Building the Observatory:** Peter needs rare or perfectly crafted components to build a new astronomical instrument. He might hire the player, a skilled smith, to forge these precise parts, requiring the highest level of craftsmanship.
*   **A Prophecy in the Stars:** Peter's observations lead him to a disturbing astrological prediction that foretells great bloodshed or a significant event in the rebellion. The player must decide what to do with this dangerous knowledge.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Peter of Denmark's worldview is one of mathematical harmony and empirical observation. He is a man of the new scientific spirit emerging in the 14th century, believing that the universe is not a place of arbitrary mysteries but a complex, divinely-ordered system that can be understood through reason and precise measurement. His philosophy is deeply practical; he is less concerned with abstract metaphysical debates and more focused on creating functional tools that can solve real-world astronomical problems. He sees the heavens as a great celestial clock, and his life's work is to build the instruments necessary to read its face. He is a bridge between the ancient astronomical tables of the past and a future of direct, instrument-based observation, a crucial step in the evolution of science.

**Major Creative Works:**
The historical Peter of Denmark (also known as Petrus Philomena de Dacia) was a pioneering astronomer and instrument maker active in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. His work was foundational for the astronomers of the 1340s.
-   **The "New Instrument" (Instrumentum Novum):** This was his most significant invention, a revolutionary type of astronomical computer known as an equatorium. Before Peter, astronomers needed multiple, complex instruments to calculate the positions of the different planets. His "New Instrument" was a single, unified device—a set of circular discs and rulers—that could be used to determine the positions of the sun, moon, and all the planets. It was a mechanical marvel that translated complex astronomical tables into a simple, elegant physical tool.
-   **Astronomical Calendar:** He created a new and highly accurate astronomical calendar that was so popular it remained in use for 150 years. A key innovation was that for every day of the year, it listed both the sun's position (declination) and the length of the day, making it incredibly useful for both scientific and civil purposes.
-   **Treatises on Algorism:** He wrote several works on "algorism," the new art of calculating with Hindu-Arabic numerals. These works helped to popularize the new, more efficient system of calculation, which was essential for the complex mathematics required by advanced astronomy.
