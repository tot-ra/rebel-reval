# Peter of Denmark

![alt text](image-8.png)

**Visual Description:**
Peter is a young man, perhaps in his late 20s, with the pale complexion of a scholar who spends most of his time indoors or awake at night. He has light blond hair, often messy, and bright, inquisitive blue eyes. He is thin and slightly stooped from years of leaning over books and charts. He wears the simple, dark robes of a university scholar, practical for work and travel. He might be seen carrying a brass astrolabe or a rolled-up parchment star chart, his most prized possessions.

**Motivations:**
Peter is driven by a profound desire to understand the heavens. He is a man of science, fascinated by the mathematical precision of the cosmos. He believes that by observing the stars and planets, he can understand the mind of God. He might be in Reval for a specific astronomical event, such as a comet or an eclipse, or perhaps he has been sent to the Dome School to teach or to establish a proper observatory. The political turmoil of the city is a frustrating distraction from his celestial studies.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** The clergy and scholars associated with the Dome School in Reval would be his natural colleagues. As a Dane, he would have some standing with the Danish administration in Toompea Castle, though they might view his work as esoteric and impractical.
*   **Enemies:** He has no enemies, but his scientific pursuits could be viewed with suspicion by the more superstitious elements of society. The pagan rebels might see his stargazing as a form of foreign magic, while the more dogmatic members of the church might worry his studies could stray into forbidden astrology.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would likely ignore Kalev at first. However, he might become interested in the smith's practical knowledge of metals for building his instruments, or perhaps he would see the rebellion through a detached, almost academic lens, as a predictable conjunction of social forces, like planets in alignment.

**History (Biography):**
Peter of Denmark was a real 14th-century Danish mathematician and astronomer, known for his work on astronomical instruments. While his exact dates are uncertain, he was active in the mid-14th century. His presence in Reval is fictional but highly plausible. As a Danish scholar, he could easily have been sent to the Duchy of Estonia to work at the well-regarded Dome School, which had been established in the 13th century and was the center of learning in the region.

**Daily Routines:**
Peter's routine is dictated by the stars. He would spend his nights on the walls of Toompea or in a high tower, meticulously recording the positions of stars and planets. His days would be spent in a study, performing complex calculations, drawing star charts, and perhaps teaching students. He would be a man out of sync with the rest of the city, sleeping while others work and working while others sleep.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Fallen Star:** A meteorite has fallen in a remote, dangerous location. Peter believes it is a piece of the heavens and hires the player to guide and protect him on a perilous expedition to retrieve it.
*   **Building the Observatory:** Peter needs rare or perfectly crafted components to build a new astronomical instrument. He might hire the player, a skilled smith, to forge these precise parts, requiring the highest level of craftsmanship.
*   **A Prophecy in the Stars:** Peter's observations lead him to a disturbing astrological prediction that foretells great bloodshed or a significant event in the rebellion. The player must decide what to do with this dangerous knowledge.
