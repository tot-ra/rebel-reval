# Jean Buridan
![alt text](image-15.png)

**Visual Description:**
A man in his early 40s, Jean Buridan is a figure of immense intellectual authority. He has a sharp, questioning face, with a high forehead and piercing eyes that seem to analyze every proposition for logical flaws. He has a neatly trimmed beard and wears the distinguished robes of a senior master of the University of Paris. He carries himself with the calm, unshakable confidence of a man who has won a thousand debates and whose ideas are shaping the intellectual landscape of Europe.

**Motivations:**
Buridan is motivated by the power of reason and the desire to expand the boundaries of human knowledge. As a leading philosopher of his time, he is famous for his development of the theory of impetus, a critical step towards modern physics. He has traveled to Reval with his brilliant student, Albert of Saxony, to observe the application of physical principles in the real world—from the flight of an arrow to the mechanics of a siege engine—and to engage in rigorous debate with the scholars of the Dome School.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** His student, Albert of Saxony. He would be a highly respected, if controversial, guest of the Dome School and the Bishopric of Dorpat.
*   **Enemies:** His ideas, which separated the domains of faith and reason, were controversial and could easily make him enemies among conservative theologians who saw his work as undermining the authority of scripture.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would be intellectually fascinated by Kalev. As a smith, Kalev has a deep, practical understanding of concepts like momentum, heat, and force. Buridan would see Kalev not as a person, but as a living laboratory, a source of empirical data for his theories of impetus. He would pepper Kalev with questions about the act of hammering, the quenching of steel, and the force of a blow.

**History (Biography):**
Jean Buridan (c. 1300–c. 1358) was a French priest and one of the most influential philosophers and logicians of the late Middle Ages. He taught at the University of Paris and made significant contributions to logic and the philosophy of science, most notably with his theory of impetus. His presence in Reval is fictional, but it creates a compelling scenario where one of the greatest scientific minds of the 14th century is present to witness and analyze the brutal physics of a medieval uprising.

**Daily Routines:**
Buridan's days are a disciplined mix of observation, teaching, and debate. He would spend his time observing the world with a scientific eye, whether it's the arc of a stone thrown from a wall or the workings of a crane at the harbor. He would engage in long, challenging debates with his student Albert and the other masters, pushing the boundaries of their understanding.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Impetus of Rebellion:** Buridan becomes obsessed with creating a formal model to explain the social "impetus" of the rebellion. He sends the player on a series of dangerous observational missions to gather "data" for his theory—counting rebel numbers, assessing their weaponry, and gauging their morale.
*   **A Debate with the Devil:** Buridan's rationalist approach to the world leads a powerful inquisitor to accuse him of being a materialist and an atheist. The player must help Buridan win a formal theological debate or be forced to flee the city.
*   **The Perfect Weapon:** Buridan believes he can use his understanding of impetus to design a far more powerful and accurate trebuchet. He hires the player to help him build and test this new weapon, which could turn the tide of the siege.
