# Jani Beg (Future Khan)

![alt text](../../skills/image.png)

**Visual Description:**
Disguised as a wealthy Tartar merchant, Jani Beg appears as a man in his late 30s. He has a strong, solid build, with the powerful shoulders of a warrior beneath his merchant's garb. His hair is black, long, and tied back neatly in a leather cord. He has a well-kept, thick black beard that frames a stern mouth. His skin is weathered from travel, and his dark, almond-shaped eyes are sharp and calculating, missing nothing. He wears a heavy kaftan of deep blue wool, its collar and cuffs lined with rich, dark marten fur. Beneath it, a tunic of fine, patterned red silk is visible at his neck. His trousers are of a simple dark wool, tucked into high boots of soft, dark brown leather.

**Motivations:**
Jani Beg's personal journey to the Baltic is driven by a complex mix of strategic goals. While securing the northern trade routes is his official cover, his true objectives are far deeper:
*   **Military Espionage:** He is here to personally study the heavily armored knights of the Livonian Order. He wants to understand their tactics, their technology (such as crossbows and siege engines), and their weaknesses firsthand, knowledge that would be invaluable in any future conflict.
*   **Technological Acquisition:** Rumors of powerful new technologies, including the explosive "black powder," have reached his court. He is actively seeking the source of these rumors, hoping to acquire a technological edge for his own armies.
*   **Political Destabilization:** He sees the uprising as a perfect opportunity to bleed a potential rival. By providing covert funding or strategic advice to certain rebel factions, he can tie the Livonian Order up in a costly internal war, preventing them from projecting power eastward.
*   **Assessing Vassals:** His presence allows him to observe the activities of his Novgorodian and Pskovian vassals, ensuring their actions align with the Horde's broader interests.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** The emirs and generals of the Golden Horde. He has a complex web of alliances with various vassal states and trading partners, including the Genoese and Venetian merchants in the Crimea.
*   **Enemies:** The Ilkhanate in Persia is a major rival. He is in a constant state of low-level conflict with the powers on his borders, including the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. The Livonian Order is a minor, distant nuisance.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** Completely and utterly insignificant. A peasant rebellion in a remote corner of the Christian world is a footnote to a footnote for the ruler of the Golden Horde. However, he would be interested in any intelligence his agents might bring back about the conflict, as it could signal a shift in the regional balance of power.

**Companions:**
Jani Beg travels with a very small, elite retinue disguised as his servants and guards.

*   **Temur "the Silent":**
    *   **Visual Description:** A man in his early 50s, Temur is built like a weathered rock. He is broad-shouldered and powerfully muscled, with a bald head and a long, grey-streaked beard braided with small iron rings. A jagged scar runs from his left temple to his jaw, giving his dark eyes a permanent, intimidating squint. He is disguised as a simple caravan guard, wearing a quilted brown wool gambeson over a plain linen tunic, with worn leather trousers and boots.
*   **Alani "the Shadow":**
    *   **Visual Description:** A young woman in her early 20s, Alani is lean and agile, with a quiet, watchful intensity. Her black hair is cut short for a woman of her culture, falling just to her chin for practicality. She has high cheekbones and sharp, dark eyes that see everything. Disguised as a servant, she wears simple, functional clothing: a loose-fitting tunic of undyed, light-brown wool, dark trousers, and soft leather boots, allowing for silent movement.

**History (Biography):**
Born in the opulent, sprawling capital of Sarai, Jani Beg was raised at the center of a vast and powerful empire. He was the Khan of the Golden Horde from 1342 to 1357, a reign often considered the zenith of the Horde's power. Possessed of a deep curiosity and a desire to understand the world he ruled, Jani Beg has done the unthinkable: he has traveled north with a trade caravan, heavily disguised as a wealthy Tartar fur merchant. The journey took him along the great rivers, through the lands of his Russian vassals, to the trading hub of Novgorod, and finally across the sea to Reval. Only a handful of his most elite, loyal bodyguards know his true identity. He is in Reval to personally observe the strange politics of the Christian crusaders and to assess the value and risks of the northern trade routes. It is a journey of immense personal risk and political consequence.

**Faction Views:**
*   **The Livonian Order & Danish Crown:** He sees them as indistinguishable and insignificant "dog-lords" of a petty, squabbling faith. Their conflict is a minor border skirmish in a land that produces little of value besides furs. He is, however, interested in their military technology and tactics.
*   **The Hanseatic League:** Useful, but not to be trusted. He sees them as greedy merchants who can be manipulated through their desire for profit. They are the key to the northern trade routes, and thus must be handled with a degree of care.
*   **Novgorod & Pskov:** His vassals. He expects them to pay their tribute and follow his orders. Their involvement in the Estonian rebellion is of interest to him only in how it might affect the stability of his northwestern frontier.
*   **The Rebels (All Factions):** A curiosity. The idea of peasants rising up against their masters is not new to him, but the religious and cultural dimensions of this conflict are a novelty. He views them with a detached anthropological interest, like a scholar observing an ant colony. They are of no real consequence to him, but their struggle might provide useful intelligence.
*   **Grand Duchy of Lithuania:** A genuine threat and a worthy rival. He respects their military prowess and their stubborn refusal to bow to any foreign power. He is wary of their expansionist ambitions and sees them as the only real player in the region besides himself.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **[Reval Market](../../scenes/revel_central_quarter/market_civic_quarter/market.md):** Operates a lavish fur trading stall here, his primary location for gathering intelligence and observing the city's inhabitants.
*   **[Reval Harbor](../../scenes/revel_north_oleviste/harbor.md):** May be seen overseeing the loading and unloading of goods, a cover for monitoring the city's trade and naval traffic.
*   **[St. Olaf's Guild Hall](../../scenes/revel_north_west_quarter_merchants/st_olafs_guild_hall.md):** Might attend meetings here, disguised as a high-ranking member of a Novgorodian trade delegation, to gain insight into the politics of the Hanseatic merchants.

**Daily Routines:**
In Reval, Jani Beg lives the part of a merchant. He operates a lavish stall in the Reval Market, using his vast wealth to trade for the finest northern furs. This disguise allows him to interact with all levels of society, from Hanseatic merchants to Novgorodian traders and even common Estonians. He is a keen observer of people, silently gathering intelligence. His bodyguards, disguised as servants and guards, are never far from his side, ready to unleash the full fury of the Horde to protect their Khan.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Khan's Emissary:** The player might encounter a Tartar emissary or a merchant from the Golden Horde in Reval, a mysterious and powerful figure who is gathering information for the Khan. This could lead to a quest involving espionage or diplomacy.
*   **The Fur Trade:** The lucrative fur trade was a key link between the Baltic and the Horde. The player could become involved in a high-stakes quest to secure a shipment of rare furs for the Khan, competing with rival merchants and navigating the dangers of the trade routes.
*   **Whispers of the Horde:** A quest could be based on the fear and rumor that the Horde might intervene in the conflict. The player might be sent to investigate rumors of a Tartar raiding party, only to discover a more complex political reality.
