# Albert of Saxony

![alt text](image-20.png)

**Visual Description:**
A young man in his early 20s, Albert of Saxony has the keen, analytical face of a natural philosopher. He is tall and thin, with sharp features and intense, focused eyes that seem to be constantly deconstructing the world around him. He wears the simple, dark robes of a university master, practical for teaching and study. He carries himself with the confidence of a brilliant young mind, eager to make his mark on the world of ideas.

**Motivations:**
Albert is motivated by logic and the pursuit of knowledge. A student of the famous Jean Buridan in Paris, he is a proponent of the new theories of impetus and motion that are revolutionizing natural philosophy. He is in Reval as a guest lecturer at the prestigious Dome School, invited to share the latest philosophical and scientific ideas from the University of Paris. He sees the world as a set of complex but ultimately solvable logical puzzles, and the chaos of the uprising is a fascinating, if dangerous, problem to be analyzed.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** The masters and students of the Dome School are his natural colleagues. He would find a patron in the Bishop of Dorpat, a known supporter of learning.
*   **Enemies:** His modern ideas could be seen as a challenge to older, more established theologians. The more superstitious elements of society might view his scientific inquiries as a form of godless magic.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as a fascinating case study in cause and effect. He would be interested in the "impetus" of the rebellion—the initial force that set it in motion. He would ask Kalev a series of probing, logical questions, trying to understand the physics of social upheaval as if it were a falling stone.

**History (Biography):**
Albert of Saxony (c. 1320–1390) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician. He was a key figure in the spread of Parisian natural philosophy throughout Germany and Italy. While his presence in Reval is fictional, it is highly plausible that a brilliant German scholar who had studied in Paris would be invited to teach at the most important center of learning in the German-speaking Baltic.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **[Dome School (Toompea Kool)](../../scenes/revel_toompea/dome_school/dome_school.md):** His primary location, where he can be found lecturing, debating, or studying in the library.
*   **[The Cathedral of Saint Mary](../../scenes/revel_toompea/cathedral_of_saint_mary/cathedral_of_saint_mary.md):** May be engaged in theological debates with the clergy here.
*   **[Town Hall Square (Raekoja plats)](../../scenes/revel_central_quarter/market_civic_quarter/town_hall_square.md):** Could be observing the social mechanics of the city, perhaps taking notes on the behavior of the crowds.

**Daily Routines:**
Albert's days are a structured routine of intellectual labor. He would spend his mornings lecturing to students at the Dome School, his afternoons in rigorous logical debate with the other masters, and his evenings studying and writing. He would be a familiar sight in the school's library and lecture halls, a beacon of Parisian logic in a distant land.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Buridan's Ass Paradox:** Albert gets into a heated debate with a conservative theologian over a point of logic and is accused of heresy. The player must help him find a way to win the debate or escape the consequences.
*   **The Physics of a Trebuchet:** The defenders of Reval are having trouble with one of their siege engines. Albert, with his knowledge of impetus and mechanics, believes he can fix it, but he needs the player's help to acquire the materials and protect him while he works on the front lines.
*   **A Logical Conclusion:** The player brings a complex strategic problem to Albert. Using his powerful command of logic, Albert analyzes the situation and provides the player with a clear, and perhaps brutally pragmatic, assessment of the most logical course of action, which may conflict with the player's sense of morality or loyalty.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Albert of Saxony is a leading mind of the 14th-century Nominalist movement, a philosophical school that would pave the way for modern scientific thought. His worldview is shaped by the teachings of his master, Jean Buridan, and the logical rigor of William of Ockham. He believes that the world can be understood through logic and direct observation. He is skeptical of abstract, universal forms, arguing that reality consists of individual things that can be analyzed and categorized. His philosophy is deeply concerned with the relationship between language, logic, and reality, and he spends much of his intellectual energy solving complex logical puzzles (*sophismata*) to clarify how language can accurately represent the world. In physics, he is a key proponent of "impetus theory," a groundbreaking idea that explains the motion of projectiles and falling objects not by the constant intervention of an outside force, but by an internal "impetus" imparted to them, a crucial step towards the modern concept of inertia.

**Major Creative Works:**
Albert was a prolific and systematic writer whose works became standard university textbooks for over a century. His contributions were primarily in the fields of logic and natural philosophy.
-   ***Perutilis Logica*** **(A Very Useful Logic):** This was his magnum opus in the field of logic, a comprehensive textbook that covered all aspects of the subject as it was understood in the 14th century. It includes influential discussions on the nature of propositions, the theory of consequences (logical deduction), and solutions to logical paradoxes.
-   ***Sophismata***: A collection of complex logical puzzles designed to test and refine a student's understanding of how language and logic work. His work in this area was highly influential, particularly his analyses of "syncategorematic" terms—words like "all," "some," "not," and "if," which are crucial for logical reasoning.
-   **Questions on Aristotle's Physics:** Like many university masters of his time, he wrote extensive commentaries on the works of Aristotle. His *Questions on the Physics* and *Questions on De Caelo (On the Heavens)* were not just summaries but critical engagements with Aristotle's ideas, where he often used Aristotelian concepts as a springboard to introduce and defend the new physics of impetus theory.
-   **Mathematical Treatises:** He also wrote on mathematics, including a work on proportions, *Tractatus de proportionibus*, which was essential for the mathematical analysis of motion.
