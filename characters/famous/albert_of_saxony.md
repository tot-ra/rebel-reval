# Albert of Saxony

**Visual Description:**
A young man in his early 20s, Albert of Saxony has the keen, analytical face of a natural philosopher. He is tall and thin, with sharp features and intense, focused eyes that seem to be constantly deconstructing the world around him. He wears the simple, dark robes of a university master, practical for teaching and study. He carries himself with the confidence of a brilliant young mind, eager to make his mark on the world of ideas.

**Motivations:**
Albert is motivated by logic and the pursuit of knowledge. A student of the famous Jean Buridan in Paris, he is a proponent of the new theories of impetus and motion that are revolutionizing natural philosophy. He is in Reval as a guest lecturer at the prestigious Dome School, invited to share the latest philosophical and scientific ideas from the University of Paris. He sees the world as a set of complex but ultimately solvable logical puzzles, and the chaos of the uprising is a fascinating, if dangerous, problem to be analyzed.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** The masters and students of the Dome School are his natural colleagues. He would find a patron in the Bishop of Dorpat, a known supporter of learning.
*   **Enemies:** His modern ideas could be seen as a challenge to older, more established theologians. The more superstitious elements of society might view his scientific inquiries as a form of godless magic.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as a fascinating case study in cause and effect. He would be interested in the "impetus" of the rebellion—the initial force that set it in motion. He would ask Kalev a series of probing, logical questions, trying to understand the physics of social upheaval as if it were a falling stone.

**History (Biography):**
Albert of Saxony (c. 1320–1390) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician. He was a key figure in the spread of Parisian natural philosophy throughout Germany and Italy. While his presence in Reval is fictional, it is highly plausible that a brilliant German scholar who had studied in Paris would be invited to teach at the most important center of learning in the German-speaking Baltic.

**Daily Routines:**
Albert's days are a structured routine of intellectual labor. He would spend his mornings lecturing to students at the Dome School, his afternoons in rigorous logical debate with the other masters, and his evenings studying and writing. He would be a familiar sight in the school's library and lecture halls, a beacon of Parisian logic in a distant land.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Buridan's Ass Paradox:** Albert gets into a heated debate with a conservative theologian over a point of logic and is accused of heresy. The player must help him find a way to win the debate or escape the consequences.
*   **The Physics of a Trebuchet:** The defenders of Reval are having trouble with one of their siege engines. Albert, with his knowledge of impetus and mechanics, believes he can fix it, but he needs the player's help to acquire the materials and protect him while he works on the front lines.
*   **A Logical Conclusion:** The player brings a complex strategic problem to Albert. Using his powerful command of logic, Albert analyzes the situation and provides the player with a clear, and perhaps brutally pragmatic, assessment of the most logical course of action, which may conflict with the player's sense of morality or loyalty.
