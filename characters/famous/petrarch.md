# Petrarch (Francesco Petrarca)

![alt text](image-16.png)

**Visual Description:**
A man in his late 30s, Petrarch has the refined, thoughtful face of a scholar and a poet. His dark hair is neatly kept, and his eyes are deep-set and melancholic, yet intensely observant. He is of a slender build. He wears the dark, high-quality robes of a traveling cleric or scholar, made of fine Italian wool, more suited to the libraries of Avignon than the muddy streets of Reval. He carries himself with an air of intellectual superiority and a slight disdain for his rustic surroundings.

**Motivations:**
Petrarch is driven by a burning passion to recover the lost works of classical antiquity. He believes the "Dark Ages" have obscured the wisdom of authors like Cicero and Livy, and he travels tirelessly to unearth forgotten manuscripts. A rumor of a lost Livy manuscript, supposedly held in the library of the remote Cistercian monastery at Padise, has drawn him to this far northern corner of the world. The political turmoil is an infuriating obstacle to his scholarly quest.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** His traveling companion, Boccaccio. He would seek the patronage and protection of the most powerful and educated figures in Reval, such as the Bishop of Dorpat or learned members of the Dome School.
*   **Enemies:** He has no personal enemies, but his mission makes him vulnerable. He would view the rebels as ignorant barbarians capable of destroying the very knowledge he seeks to preserve.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as a symbol of the brutish, uneducated world he despises. He would be dismissive and arrogant, unless Kalev proved to have some unexpected knowledge or could help him access a location he needed, in which case he would become a demanding and difficult patron.

**History (Biography):**
Francesco Petrarca (1304â€“1374) was an Italian scholar and poet, one of the earliest and most influential figures of the Renaissance. His rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often cited as a catalyst for the 14th-century Renaissance. He was an avid traveler and manuscript hunter. While he never historically traveled to Estonia, his documented journeys and obsessive search for lost texts make his fictional presence in pursuit of a rumored manuscript entirely in character.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **[Dome School (Toompea Kool)](../../scenes/revel_toompea/dome_school/dome_school.md):** Can be found in the library, impatiently scouring the collection for any hint of classical texts.
*   **[Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine](../../scenes/revel_east/dominican_monastery/dominican_monastery.md):** He would petition the monks to gain access to their library, another potential repository of lost knowledge.
*   **[Padise Monastery](../../scenes/world/padise/padise_monastery.md):** His ultimate goal. The quest to reach this monastery, located deep in rebel-held territory, would be a major plot point for his character.

**Daily Routines:**
Petrarch's days in Reval are a frustrating mix of research and waiting. He would spend as much time as possible in the libraries of the Dome School or local monasteries, poring over any texts he can get his hands on. He would also spend a great deal of time writing letters to his contacts across Europe and composing poetry, lamenting his distance from his beloved Italy.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Lost Library:** Petrarch hires the player to guide and protect him on a dangerous journey to the Padise Monastery, which is located in the heart of the rebellion, in search of the lost manuscript.
*   **A Scholar's Scorn:** The player might need a piece of information that only Petrarch possesses, and must first earn the respect of the arrogant scholar, perhaps by retrieving a stolen book or performing some other service for him.
*   **The Poet and the Pagan:** Petrarch becomes fascinated by the oral traditions and runosongs of the Estonians, seeing them as a crude but living link to an ancient past. He might ask the player to introduce him to a traditional singer, leading to an unexpected cultural exchange.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Petrarch is the quintessential "father of Humanism." His worldview represents a pivotal shift from the medieval to the Renaissance mindset. He is a devout Catholic, yet he argues passionately that God granted humanity its intellect and creativity to be used to the fullest. He sees no conflict between faith and the rigorous study of classical, pre-Christian authors. In fact, he believes that the wisdom of ancient Rome and Greece is essential for living a virtuous, moral life. He is deeply introspective, constantly wrestling with the conflict between his worldly ambitions (for fame, for love) and his spiritual aspirations. He champions a life of scholarly solitude (*vita contemplativa*) as the highest calling, believing that the recovery and study of ancient texts is the key to emerging from what he famously termed the "Dark Ages."

**Major Creative Works:**
Petrarch was a prolific writer in both Latin, the language of scholarship, and the Italian vernacular, which he used for his most famous poetic work.
-   ***Il Canzoniere*** **(The Songbook):** This is his masterpiece and one of the most influential works in Western literature. It is a collection of 366 poems, mostly sonnets, that chronicle his unrequited, idealized love for a woman named Laura. The work is revolutionary for its deep psychological introspection, exploring the complex and often contradictory emotions of the speaker. It established the "Petrarchan sonnet" as a major poetic form and created a model for love poetry that would dominate Europe for centuries.
-   **Latin Works:** Petrarch considered his Latin writings to be his most important work, intended to revive the glories of classical literature. These include:
    -   ***Africa***: An epic poem about the Roman general Scipio Africanus, intended to be a new *Aeneid*.
    -   ***Secretum Meum*** **(My Secret Book):** A deeply personal prose dialogue between himself and St. Augustine, in which he examines his own moral and spiritual failings.
    -   **Epistolary Collections:** He meticulously collected and edited his own letters, modeling them on the letters of his hero, Cicero. These letters were intended for a wide audience and helped to establish his reputation as the leading intellectual of his age.
-   **Manuscript Hunting:** Beyond his own writing, one of his greatest "works" was his tireless effort to rediscover lost classical manuscripts in monastic libraries across Europe. His famous rediscovery of a collection of Cicero's letters in Verona in 1345 is often seen as a symbolic starting point for the Renaissance.
