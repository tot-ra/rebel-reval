# Petrarch (Francesco Petrarca)

![alt text](image-16.png)

**Visual Description:**
A man in his late 30s, Petrarch has the refined, thoughtful face of a scholar and a poet. His dark hair is neatly kept, and his eyes are deep-set and melancholic, yet intensely observant. He is of a slender build. He wears the dark, high-quality robes of a traveling cleric or scholar, made of fine Italian wool, more suited to the libraries of Avignon than the muddy streets of Reval. He carries himself with an air of intellectual superiority and a slight disdain for his rustic surroundings.

**Motivations:**
Petrarch is driven by a burning passion to recover the lost works of classical antiquity. He believes the "Dark Ages" have obscured the wisdom of authors like Cicero and Livy, and he travels tirelessly to unearth forgotten manuscripts. A rumor of a lost Livy manuscript, supposedly held in the library of the remote Cistercian monastery at Padise, has drawn him to this far northern corner of the world. The political turmoil is an infuriating obstacle to his scholarly quest.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** His traveling companion, Boccaccio. He would seek the patronage and protection of the most powerful and educated figures in Reval, such as the Bishop of Dorpat or learned members of the Dome School.
*   **Enemies:** He has no personal enemies, but his mission makes him vulnerable. He would view the rebels as ignorant barbarians capable of destroying the very knowledge he seeks to preserve.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as a symbol of the brutish, uneducated world he despises. He would be dismissive and arrogant, unless Kalev proved to have some unexpected knowledge or could help him access a location he needed, in which case he would become a demanding and difficult patron.

**History (Biography):**
Francesco Petrarca (1304â€“1374) was an Italian scholar and poet, one of the earliest and most influential figures of the Renaissance. His rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often cited as a catalyst for the 14th-century Renaissance. He was an avid traveler and manuscript hunter. While he never historically traveled to Estonia, his documented journeys and obsessive search for lost texts make his fictional presence in pursuit of a rumored manuscript entirely in character.

**Daily Routines:**
Petrarch's days in Reval are a frustrating mix of research and waiting. He would spend as much time as possible in the libraries of the Dome School or local monasteries, poring over any texts he can get his hands on. He would also spend a great deal of time writing letters to his contacts across Europe and composing poetry, lamenting his distance from his beloved Italy.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Lost Library:** Petrarch hires the player to guide and protect him on a dangerous journey to the Padise Monastery, which is located in the heart of the rebellion, in search of the lost manuscript.
*   **A Scholar's Scorn:** The player might need a piece of information that only Petrarch possesses, and must first earn the respect of the arrogant scholar, perhaps by retrieving a stolen book or performing some other service for him.
*   **The Poet and the Pagan:** Petrarch becomes fascinated by the oral traditions and runosongs of the Estonians, seeing them as a crude but living link to an ancient past. He might ask the player to introduce him to a traditional singer, leading to an unexpected cultural exchange.
