# Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio
![alt text](image-12.png)
**Visual Description:**
A young man in his early teens, Giovanni Dondi is a prodigy, already possessing a mind of formidable precision and skill. He is thin and wiry, with dark, incredibly intense eyes that seem to see the world as a series of interlocking gears. His fingers are long and nimble, often stained with oil and metal filings. He dresses in the practical, dark clothes of a master artisan, perhaps with a leather apron covered in pockets for his specialized tools.

**Motivations:**
Dondi is motivated by a singular, all-consuming passion: to replicate the perfect mechanics of the cosmos in a machine. He is the designer of the legendary Astrarium, a complex astronomical clock that models the movements of the sun, moon, and planets. He has been commissioned by the wealthy merchants of the Hanseatic League to build a magnificent astronomical clock for the city of Reval, a symbol of their wealth and modernity. The uprising is a disastrous complication that threatens his delicate work and his access to materials.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** His patrons in the Hanseatic League. He would be a respected, if somewhat feared, figure among the city's artisans and smiths, who would be in awe of his skill.
*   **Enemies:** He has no enemies, but his workshop, filled with priceless tools and complex machinery, would be a tempting target for looters. His work could also be seen as a form of magic or hubris by the more superstitious.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as a master of a cruder, but still essential, craft. He would be intensely interested in Kalev's skills in forging and metalworking, and might hire him to create the larger, structural components of his clock. He would be a demanding and exacting employer, obsessed with precision.

**History (Biography):**
Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio (1330â€“1388) was an Italian physician, astronomer, and clockmaker from a family of clockmakers. He designed and built the Astrarium, one of the first and most complex astronomical clocks, between 1348 and 1364. His fictional presence in Reval in 1343 as a young prodigy on his first major commission is a compelling way to introduce the theme of cutting-edge medieval technology into the game.

**Scene Presence:**
*   **[St. Olaf's Guild Hall](../../scenes/revel_north_west_quarter_merchants/st_olafs_guild_hall.md):** He has been given a secure, private workshop in the upper levels of the guild hall, funded by his Hanseatic patrons. This is his primary location.
*   **[The Smith's Forge](../../scenes/revel_east/forge/forge.md):** He may visit the player's forge to commission or oversee the creation of the large, structural components required for his clock.
*   **[Town Council's Apothecary (Raeapteek)](../../scenes/revel_central_quarter/apothecary.md):** Could be found here acquiring rare chemicals and minerals needed for finishing and treating the delicate metal parts of his clock.

**Daily Routines:**
Dondi's life is his workshop. He would spend nearly all his waking hours in a specially secured room, perhaps in the St. Olaf's Guild Hall, surrounded by his designs, tools, and the fantastically complex brass and iron components of his clock. His routine is one of absolute focus and precision, filing, fitting, and assembling the thousands of parts that make up his masterpiece.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Celestial Gear:** A crucial, incredibly complex gear for the clock has been stolen. Dondi hires the player to track down the thief and recover the irreplaceable component before his entire project is ruined.
*   **A Smith's Precision:** Dondi requires a special alloy or a perfectly forged component that only the player, with their unique skills, can create. This would involve a difficult and demanding crafting quest.
*   **The Clock of Ages:** As the siege of Reval tightens, Dondi's clock becomes more than just a machine. Different factions believe that when it is completed and chimes for the first time, it will trigger a prophesied event or grant a supernatural advantage. The player must protect the clock and its maker from those who would seek to control or destroy it.

**Worldview and Philosophy:**
Giovanni Dondi's worldview is one of cosmic order and mechanical precision. As a physician, astronomer, and engineer, he sees the universe as a vast, intricate, and divinely-created clockwork mechanism. His philosophy is rooted in the Ptolemaic, geocentric model of the cosmos, and he believes that the complex movements of the heavens can be understood, predicted, and replicated through mathematics and mechanics. He is a man of the emerging Renaissance, blending the scholastic tradition of synthesizing ancient authorities (like Aristotle and the astronomer Ptolemy) with a new, hands-on approach to engineering. For him, building the Astrarium is an act of intellectual devotion, a way to demonstrate the rational, predictable harmony of God's creation. He is a perfectionist, driven by the belief that human ingenuity can create a machine that mirrors the perfection of the heavens.

**Major Creative Works:**
Giovanni Dondi's life was dedicated to one monumental creation, a machine so complex and legendary that it became one of the wonders of its age.
-   **The Astrarium:** This is his magnum opus. It was not merely a clock for telling time, but a complex mechanical planetarium that modeled the entire known cosmos. It took him 16 years to build (from 1348 to 1364).
    -   **Function:** The Astrarium had seven faces and over 100 gears, showing the positions and motions of the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets known at the time (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), all according to the complex epicyclic theories of Ptolemaic astronomy. It also displayed the calendar, religious feast days, and the phases of the moon.
    -   **Significance:** It was a technological marvel, demonstrating an unprecedented level of mechanical and astronomical sophistication. It was a physical embodiment of the medieval scientific worldview, a proof of concept that the universe operated on predictable, rational principles that could be replicated by human hands.
-   ***Tractatus Astrarii*** **(Treatise on the Astrarium):** Perhaps as important as the machine itself, Dondi wrote a detailed manuscript that described the design and construction of his Astrarium in meticulous detail. This work is one of the earliest and most complete technical treatises of its kind, providing an invaluable window into the mind of a 14th-century engineer and the state of medieval technology. It was a blueprint for his masterpiece, ensuring that the knowledge of its creation would not be lost.
