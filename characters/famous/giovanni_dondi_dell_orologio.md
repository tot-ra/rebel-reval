# Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio
![alt text](image-12.png)
**Visual Description:**
A young man in his early teens, Giovanni Dondi is a prodigy, already possessing a mind of formidable precision and skill. He is thin and wiry, with dark, incredibly intense eyes that seem to see the world as a series of interlocking gears. His fingers are long and nimble, often stained with oil and metal filings. He dresses in the practical, dark clothes of a master artisan, perhaps with a leather apron covered in pockets for his specialized tools.

**Motivations:**
Dondi is motivated by a singular, all-consuming passion: to replicate the perfect mechanics of the cosmos in a machine. He is the designer of the legendary Astrarium, a complex astronomical clock that models the movements of the sun, moon, and planets. He has been commissioned by the wealthy merchants of the Hanseatic League to build a magnificent astronomical clock for the city of Reval, a symbol of their wealth and modernity. The uprising is a disastrous complication that threatens his delicate work and his access to materials.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** His patrons in the Hanseatic League. He would be a respected, if somewhat feared, figure among the city's artisans and smiths, who would be in awe of his skill.
*   **Enemies:** He has no enemies, but his workshop, filled with priceless tools and complex machinery, would be a tempting target for looters. His work could also be seen as a form of magic or hubris by the more superstitious.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev as a master of a cruder, but still essential, craft. He would be intensely interested in Kalev's skills in forging and metalworking, and might hire him to create the larger, structural components of his clock. He would be a demanding and exacting employer, obsessed with precision.

**History (Biography):**
Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio (1330â€“1388) was an Italian physician, astronomer, and clockmaker from a family of clockmakers. He designed and built the Astrarium, one of the first and most complex astronomical clocks, between 1348 and 1364. His fictional presence in Reval in 1343 as a young prodigy on his first major commission is a compelling way to introduce the theme of cutting-edge medieval technology into the game.

**Daily Routines:**
Dondi's life is his workshop. He would spend nearly all his waking hours in a specially secured room, perhaps in the St. Olaf's Guild Hall, surrounded by his designs, tools, and the fantastically complex brass and iron components of his clock. His routine is one of absolute focus and precision, filing, fitting, and assembling the thousands of parts that make up his masterpiece.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Celestial Gear:** A crucial, incredibly complex gear for the clock has been stolen. Dondi hires the player to track down the thief and recover the irreplaceable component before his entire project is ruined.
*   **A Smith's Precision:** Dondi requires a special alloy or a perfectly forged component that only the player, with their unique skills, can create. This would involve a difficult and demanding crafting quest.
*   **The Clock of Ages:** As the siege of Reval tightens, Dondi's clock becomes more than just a machine. Different factions believe that when it is completed and chimes for the first time, it will trigger a prophesied event or grant a supernatural advantage. The player must protect the clock and its maker from those who would seek to control or destroy it.
