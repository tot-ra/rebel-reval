# Berthold Schwarz

![alt text](image-4.png)

**Visual Description:**
Berthold Schwarz is a man of indeterminate age, though likely in his 40s or 50s. He has a gaunt, scholarly appearance, with long, thin fingers often stained with chemicals. His grey hair is wild and unkempt, and his dark eyes have a manic, obsessive gleam. He wears the simple, dark robes of a Franciscan monk, but they are often singed, stained, and smelling faintly of sulfur and other strange chemicals. He is more at home in a laboratory than a monastery.

**Motivations:**
Berthold is driven by a relentless quest for knowledge, specifically the hidden knowledge of alchemy. He is obsessed with the transmutation of matter and the discovery of the philosopher's stone. His discovery of gunpowder was likely an accident, a spectacular and terrifying byproduct of his alchemical experiments. He is not motivated by wealth or power in the traditional sense, but by the desire to unlock the secrets of creation itself. He might have traveled to the Baltic, a land of strange pagan traditions and unique natural resources, in search of rare ingredients or forgotten knowledge.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** He has no true allies, only patrons who might fund his research in exchange for his knowledge. He would be a deeply solitary figure.
*   **Enemies:** The established church would view his experiments with deep suspicion, seeing them as a form of demonic magic. The Livonian Order might see him as a potential asset to be controlled or a dangerous rogue to be eliminated.
*   **Initial view of the main player (Kalev):** He would see Kalev not as a person, but as a source of materials and skills. He would be intensely interested in the smith's knowledge of metals, fires, and forging, believing that the ancient craft of smithing holds clues to the deeper secrets of alchemy.

**History (Biography):**
Berthold Schwarz is a legendary figure, a German alchemist and Franciscan monk from the 14th century who is often credited with the invention of gunpowder in Europe. Historical accounts are scarce and often contradictory, and many scholars believe he is more of a symbolic figure representing the arrival of gunpowder technology than a real person. According to legend, he was an alchemist who accidentally discovered the explosive properties of a mixture of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal while conducting experiments. His presence in Estonia is purely fictional, but plausible within the context of a wandering scholar seeking knowledge in the far corners of Europe.

**Daily Routines:**
Berthold's days are spent in seclusion, hunched over bubbling alembics and cryptic manuscripts. He is nocturnal by nature, working late into the night in a hidden workshop, the air thick with strange fumes. He would only emerge to acquire rare materials, perhaps from the player, or to conduct secretive outdoor experiments.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
*   **The Devil's Brew:** The player could be tasked with gathering rare and dangerous ingredients for one of Berthold's experiments (e.g., sulfur from a volcanic vent, rare herbs from a pagan sacred grove).
*   **A Louder Bang:** Berthold might hire the player to help him test his new invention, "black powder." This could lead to a quest where the player uses primitive explosives to, for example, breach a castle wall or clear a blocked passage.
*   **The Alchemist's Secret:** The Livonian Order might learn of Berthold's existence and try to capture him and his secrets. The player could be caught in the middle, having to choose between protecting the eccentric alchemist or turning him over to the authorities.
