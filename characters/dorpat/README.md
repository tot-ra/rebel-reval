# Bishopric of Dorpat

## History and Political Situation (1340-1345)

The Bishopric of Dorpat occupied one of the most precarious positions in 14th-century Livonia. As a prince-bishopric on the eastern edge of Christendom, it faced a constant dual threat: the looming power of the Russian principalities (particularly Pskov and Novgorod) to the east, and the ever-present risk of internal uprisings by the native Estonian population.

Ecclesiastically, Dorpat was subordinate to the **Archbishop of Riga**, but its geographical isolation often forced it to act with a high degree of autonomy. The relationship with the **Livonian Order** was one of cautious and often strained cooperation. While the bishops of Dorpat were generally on better terms with the Order than the Archbishop of Riga was, they were still wary of the Order's ambition and its tendency to use crises to expand its own power. This created a natural, if informal, alliance with the Danish Duchy of Estonia to the north, as both faced similar threats and sought to counterbalance the Order's influence.

The St. George's Night Uprising (1343-1345) threw this delicate balance into chaos. For Dorpat, the uprising was not just a distant problem in Harria; it manifested as local revolts and, more dangerously, provided an opportunity for the Principality of Pskov to invade. Bishop Johann I von Vifhusen, who came to power in 1343, was immediately plunged into a fight for his bishopric's survival on two fronts.

## Motivations and Goals

*   **Defend the Eastern Frontier:** The primary and most pressing goal was the military defense of the bishopric against invasions from Pskov and Novgorod. This was a matter of survival for the Catholic territory.
*   **Maintain Internal Order:** Suppressing local Estonian uprisings was crucial. The bishop could not afford to fight a war on two fronts, making the swift and often brutal quelling of internal rebellion a top priority.
*   **Preserve Autonomy:** While an alliance with the Livonian Order was often a military necessity, the Bishop was highly motivated to prevent the Order from gaining a permanent foothold or seizing control of key castles within his territory.
*   **Hanseatic Trade:** Dorpat was an important Hanseatic trade center. A key motivation was to protect these trade routes and the wealth they generated, which was essential for funding the bishopric's defense.

## Dislikes and Conflicts

*   **Principality of Pskov and Novgorod:** The most immediate and existential military threat. The Russian princes were seen as schismatic rivals waiting for any sign of weakness to attack.
*   **Internal Rebels:** The Estonian rebels were a dangerous internal threat that undermined the bishopric's stability and ability to defend itself from external enemies.
*   **The Livonian Order's Ambition:** While a necessary ally at times, the Order's relentless drive for power and land was a constant source of suspicion. The Bishop of Dorpat had to be careful that the Order's "help" did not turn into a de facto occupation.
*   **Archbishop of Riga:** While technically his superior, the Bishop of Dorpat might resent the Archbishop's attempts to exert authority or draw Dorpat into his own conflicts with the Order, especially when Dorpat had more immediate threats to deal with on its own border.

## Core NPCs

*   **Bishop Johannes V von Vechten:** The ruling Prince-Bishop of Dorpat. A man defined by the harsh realities of his frontier state, he is more of a military commander and pragmatist than a theologian. He is forced to make difficult alliances to protect his flock and his power.
*   **A Pskovian Voivode:** The commander of a Russian army, seeking to exploit the chaos of the uprising to capture territory and plunder the wealthy city of Dorpat.
*   **A Rebel Leader:** An Estonian elder from within the bishopric's lands. He may be motivated by a desire for freedom, or he may be secretly in league with Pskov, hoping to trade one master for another.
*   **A Knight-Brother of the Livonian Order:** Stationed in a nearby castle, he offers military aid but at a steep price, demanding concessions that would increase the Order's influence in the region.

## Governance and Daily Life

Life in the Bishopric of Dorpat was shaped by its frontier status and the constant need for defense.

*   **Governance:** The Prince-Bishop was the absolute ruler, but he relied on a council of canons from the cathedral chapter for administration and advice. He also granted fiefs to loyal German knights (vassals) who administered the land, collected taxes, and provided military service. The city of Dorpat itself was a major Hanseatic trading hub with a degree of self-governance, but it was ultimately under the Bishop's authority.
*   **Military:** The Bishopric maintained its own army, composed of a small core of professional men-at-arms and a larger levy of vassal knights and their retainers. This force was primarily focused on defending the eastern border against Russian raids and suppressing local uprisings. The construction and maintenance of castles, like the massive Dorpat Cathedral complex, were the cornerstones of their defensive strategy. In times of major crisis, they would be forced to cooperate with the Livonian Order, their powerful and often overbearing ally.
*   **Economy and Taxation:** The bishopric's economy was a mix of agriculture from its rural estates and wealth from the bustling trade that flowed through the city of Dorpat. Taxes were collected from the peasantry in the form of agricultural produce (grain, livestock) and from the city's merchants in the form of tariffs and duties on goods. This income was essential for funding the army and maintaining the bishopric's fortifications.
*   **Religion and Clergy:** Dorpat was a major religious and educational center. The cathedral and its associated school were staffed by a significant number of canons, priests, and monks. They were responsible for the spiritual life of the German and Danish colonists, as well as the ongoing, and often difficult, mission to convert the native Estonian population.
