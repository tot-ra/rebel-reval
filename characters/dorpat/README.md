# Bishopric of Dorpat

## History and Political Situation (1340-1345)

The Bishopric of Dorpat, a prince-bishopric within the Livonian Confederation, faced significant turmoil during this period. The era was marked by the St. George's Night Uprising (1343-1345), which, while centered elsewhere, created widespread instability. Historical fragments suggest the bishopric contended with internal revolts and an invasion from the neighboring Russian principality of Pskov, which reportedly gathered 5,000 men. The ruling bishop during this tumultuous period was **Johann I von Vifhusen (also known as Vyffhusen)**, who began his long tenure in 1343. He would have been immediately consumed with managing the internal rebellion and the external military threat from Pskov.

## Motivations

*   **Survive and Suppress:** Quell the internal uprisings that threatened the Bishopric's stability and control.
*   **Defend Borders:** Repel the invasion from Pskov and secure the eastern frontier.
*   **Maintain Autonomy:** Preserve the Bishopric's independence against the growing power of the Livonian Order, which was actively suppressing the rebellions in the region.
*   **Seek Alliances:** Potentially forge temporary alliances of convenience to deal with the immediate threats, whether with the Livonian Order or other regional powers.

## Core NPCs

*   **Bishop Johann I von Vifhusen:** The ruling Prince-Bishop of Dorpat, who took office in 1343 at the height of the crisis. His primary focus would be on suppressing the rebellion, repelling the Pskovian invasion, and securing his own authority over the bishopric.
*   **A Pskovian Voivode:** The leader of the Russian military force invading the bishopric's lands, seeking to exploit the chaos.
*   **A Rebel Leader:** An Estonian leader from within the bishopric, fighting against the authority of the Bishop and the German-Danish nobility.
