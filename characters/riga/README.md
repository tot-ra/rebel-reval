# Archbishopric of Riga

## History and Political Situation (1340-1345)

The Archbishopric of Riga, as the seat of spiritual authority in Livonia, was a central player in the region's power dynamics. This period was overshadowed by the St. George's Night Uprising (1343-1345). While the Archbishop was not a direct military leader in the same way as the Livonian Order, he would have been deeply involved in the political and religious dimensions of the conflict. The Archbishopric was in a constant state of frontier warfare with the Principality of Pskov. The years leading up to 1346 were also critical, as the Livonian Order was finalizing its purchase of the Duchy of Estonia from Denmark, a move that would significantly alter the balance of power in the region.

## Motivations

*   **Assert Religious Authority:** Use the crisis to reinforce the Catholic Church's power and moral authority over both the native populations and the crusading orders.
*   **Mediate and Influence:** Act as a mediator between the Livonian Order, other bishoprics, and external powers, using diplomatic influence to shape the outcome of the conflict.
*   **Protect Church Lands:** Ensure the security of the Archbishopric's extensive landholdings from the ravages of war and rebellion.
*   **Manage Relationship with the Livonian Order:** Navigate the complex and often tense relationship with the Livonian Order, which was the primary military power in the region but also a rival for political dominance.

## Core NPCs

*   **The Archbishop of Riga:** The head of the Catholic Church in Livonia, focused on political maneuvering, diplomacy, and preserving the Church's influence amidst the widespread chaos.
*   **A Papal Legate:** A representative from the Pope, sent to observe the situation, report back to Rome, and ensure the actions of the Livonian Order and the bishops align with the Church's interests.
*   **A Canon of the Riga Cathedral Chapter:** An influential member of the Archbishop's council, involved in the day-to-day governance of the archbishopric and advising the Archbishop.
