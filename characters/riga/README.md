# Archbishopric of Riga

## History and Political Situation (1340-1345)

The Archbishopric of Riga stood as the spiritual and, ostensibly, the most senior political authority in 14th-century Livonia. However, this authority was perpetually challenged, creating a complex and volatile political landscape.

The 14th century was a period of significant internal consolidation for the Archbishopric. The archbishops expanded their influence by granting lands to a vast network of over 2,000 secular vassals, including powerful families like the Tiesenhausens and Rozens. This created a strong feudal power base, with the Archbishop controlling 22 castles and major cities like Koknese and Limbaži.

However, the Archbishopric's primary challenge was its tense and often hostile relationship with the **Livonian Order**. While Riga was technically the administrative center for both, the city was also the economic and military base for the Order, leading to a constant power struggle. The Order frequently sought to undermine the Archbishop's authority and expand its own territorial control, particularly in regions like Curonia.

The period of the St. George's Night Uprising (1343-1345) intensified these existing tensions. The Archbishop was thrust into the role of a reluctant mediator, attempting to protect the Church's vast landholdings and spiritual authority amidst the chaos, while also trying to prevent the Livonian Order from using the rebellion as a pretext to seize more power. The impending sale of the Duchy of Estonia from Denmark to the Order was a major concern, as it threatened to dramatically tip the balance of power in the Order's favor.

## Motivations and Goals

*   **Preserve Primacy:** The Archbishop's foremost goal was to assert and maintain the Church's spiritual and temporal authority over all other powers in Livonia, especially the ambitious Livonian Order.
*   **Maintain the Balance of Power:** To counter the Order, the Archbishop sought to build and maintain a coalition with the other Livonian bishoprics (Dorpat and Ösel-Wiek), as well as external powers like the Danish Crown or even the Republic of Novgorod, to prevent the Order's dominance.
*   **Protect Church Lands and Revenue:** The Archbishopric was a wealthy state with vast estates, castles, and cities. A key motivation was to protect these assets from the ravages of war, rebellion, and the Order's expansionist policies.
*   **Spiritual Guidance (and Political Influence):** While genuinely responsible for the spiritual well-being of Livonia's Catholics, this role was also a powerful political tool, used to legitimize their authority and rally support against their rivals.

## Dislikes and Conflicts

*   **The Livonian Order:** The primary antagonist. The Archbishop viewed the Order as arrogant, insubordinate, and a threat to the Church's rightful authority. Their military power and ruthless ambition were a constant source of conflict.
*   **Pagan Rebels:** The uprising was a direct threat to the Church's mission and its property. While the Archbishop might sympathize with some of the peasants' grievances against the Order, the pagan-fueled rebellion was an anathema to him.
*   **Hanseatic Merchants:** While trade brought wealth, the independent and profit-driven nature of the Hanseatic merchants could sometimes conflict with the Archbishop's desire for centralized control and taxation.

## Core NPCs

*   **Archbishop Fromhold von Tiesenhausen:** The spiritual leader of Livonia. A shrewd and experienced political operator, he is a master of diplomacy and ecclesiastical law, constantly working to outmaneuver the Livonian Order and preserve the Church's power.
*   **A Papal Legate:** A representative of the Pope, sent from Avignon to investigate the chaos in Livonia. He is an impartial but powerful figure, whose report could have massive consequences for both the Archbishop and the Order.
*   **A Canon of the Riga Cathedral Chapter:** An influential member of the Archbishop's inner circle. The canons were often from powerful Livonian noble families, and this one may have his own agenda, perhaps aligning more closely with his family's interests than the Archbishop's.
*   **A Vassal Knight:** A loyal knight sworn to the Archbishop, responsible for defending one of the Archbishop's many castles. He provides a more grounded, military perspective on the conflict.

## Governance and Daily Life

The Archbishopric of Riga was a complex feudal state where the Archbishop wielded both spiritual and immense secular power.

*   **Governance:** The Archbishop ruled through a vast network of over 2,000 secular vassals. These vassals, including powerful families like the Tiesenhausens and Rozens, were granted land in exchange for military service and loyalty. The Archbishop himself maintained a mobile court, residing in a network of 22 castles, with his main administrative centers at Koknese, Limbaži, and Rauna. Major cities like Koknese and Limbaži had a degree of autonomy, with their own burgomasters and councils who were themselves vassals of the Archbishop.
*   **Military:** The Archbishop maintained his own military forces, drawn from his vassal knights and their retinues. These forces were responsible for defending the Archbishop's 22 castles and extensive lands. While technically separate from the Livonian Order, they would often have to coordinate with or operate against the Order's forces depending on the political situation.
*   **Economy and Taxation:** The Archbishopric was incredibly wealthy. Its income was derived from multiple sources: tithes from the entire ecclesiastical province, revenue from its vast landholdings (agriculture, forestry, fishing), taxes on trade passing through its cities, and fees from its courts. This wealth was used to fund the Archbishop's court, his army, and the construction and maintenance of castles and churches. The sheer scale of this wealth is shown by a transaction in 1361, where a vassal paid the Archbishop 576 kilograms of pure silver for control of two regions.
*   **Religion and Clergy:** As the seat of the Archbishop, Riga was the religious heart of Livonia. The Riga Cathedral Chapter was a powerful body of high-ranking clergy who advised the Archbishop and played a key role in the governance of the see. The Archbishopric would have had a large number of priests, monks, and other clergy to administer to the spiritual needs of the population and manage the Church's extensive properties.
