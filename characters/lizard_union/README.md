## The Lizard Union ðŸ¦Ž
- **Core Value:** Ambition
- **Ideal:** To forge a new Livonian order, free from the rigid doctrines of the great powers, where cunning and merit determine strength.
- **Shadow:** Their ambition is a cold fire, consuming loyalty and honor in its path. They are masters of betrayal, willing to sacrifice any piece on the board to win the game.

### Overview
The Lizard Union is a clandestine fraternity of disaffected Prussian and German-Baltic nobles, wealthy merchants, and disillusioned knights. Operating from the shadows of Reval, they are the hidden players in the great game for control of Livonia. Publicly, they maintain their standing within the ruling class, but privately, they conspire to dismantle the power of the Livonian Order and the Danish Crown from within.

They see the St. George's Night Uprising not as a righteous rebellion or a heretical scourge, but as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. By subtly fueling the flames of chaos, they aim to weaken their rivals and position themselves to seize control in the aftermath. They are neither rulers nor rebels, but a third force, playing both sides against the middle.

### Goals
- To undermine the authority of the Livonian Order and the Danish Crown in Estonia.
- To exploit the chaos of the uprising to acquire land, wealth, and political influence.
- To establish an independent, oligarchic state in Livonia, ruled by a council of their own members.
- To recruit influential individuals from all factions, using a combination of bribery, blackmail, and promises of power.

### Beliefs & Philosophy
The Union's philosophy is one of cynical pragmatism. They believe that the grand ideals of faith, honor, and loyalty are merely tools used by the powerful to control the weak. True power, they contend, lies in understanding and manipulating the hidden currents of greed and fear that drive all men. Their symbol, the lizard, represents their ability to adapt, to shed old skins, and to survive in a world of predators.

### Key Members
- **[Nikolaus von Danzig](nikolaus_von_danzig.md):** A charismatic and enigmatic Prussian knight who serves as the Union's spymaster in Reval. He is the player's primary point of contact with the faction.
- **Countess Ilsa von UexkÃ¼ll:** A wealthy and influential widow who provides the Union with financial backing and access to the highest levels of Reval society.
- **Reinhold the Rat:** A cunning merchant and smuggler who manages the Union's clandestine operations in the harbor.
