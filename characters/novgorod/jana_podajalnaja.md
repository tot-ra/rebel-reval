# Яна Подаяльная

**Visual Description:** The head of the Novgorodian trade delegation. A shrewd diplomat who can offer vast resources, but her support always comes at a steep price. She is elegantly dressed in the style of Novgorod, with rich fabrics and intricate embroidery. She has a sharp, intelligent face and a charming smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. She is always accompanied by two imposing guards.
