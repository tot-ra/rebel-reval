# Яна Подаяльная

**Visual Description:**
Яна is a woman in her early 40s, with a commanding presence that belies her graceful figure. She has long, fiery red hair, meticulously styled in an intricate braid, and piercing dark eyes that seem to assess everyone and everything with unnerving accuracy. Her complexion is pale and smooth, a testament to a life lived away from the sun and toil. She dresses in the finest Novgorodian fashion, favoring deep blues and rich reds, her clothes made of silk and velvet, adorned with silver embroidery and pearls.

**Motivations:**
To expand Novgorod's economic and political influence throughout the region. She is a firm believer in the superiority of Novgorod's republican system and will use any means necessary to ensure its dominance. She is driven by a personal ambition to become one of the most powerful figures in the republic.

**Ties & Relationships:**
- **Allies:** She has powerful connections among the merchant guilds and the ruling council of Novgorod. She is also known to have a network of spies and agents in every major city in the region.
- **Enemies:** Any who stand in the way of Novgorod's ambitions. This includes the Livonian Order, the Danish crown, and the burgeoning independence movement in Pskov.
- **Initial view of the main player:** A pawn to be used. She will see the player as a potentially valuable asset and will not hesitate to use them to advance her own goals. She will be charming and generous, but her support will always come with strings attached.
- **Relationship with other Novgorod characters:**
    - **Goytan, Prokhor of Gorodets:** She is the patron of the arts, and sees them as assets to Novgorod's cultural influence. She provides them with protection and resources, but expects their loyalty and service in return. She may use them to create lavish gifts for potential allies or to spread Novgorodian influence through religious art.
    - **Sergius of Radonezh:** She respects his spiritual authority and the influence he has over the common people. While she may not share his deep piety, she understands the power of faith and will use his presence in Reval to her advantage, perhaps by publicly associating herself with him to bolster her own reputation.

**History (Biography):**
Born into a powerful merchant family in Novgorod, Яна was educated in diplomacy, economics, and the art of political maneuvering from a young age. She quickly proved to be a prodigious talent, outshining her male counterparts in the cutthroat world of Novgorodian politics. She rose through the ranks of the trade delegation, earning a reputation as a brilliant and ruthless negotiator. She has been instrumental in securing several key trade agreements for Novgorod, and her influence in the republic is second only to the Posadnik himself.

**Daily Routines:**
Her days are filled with meetings, negotiations, and the constant exchange of information. She holds court in the Novgorodian trade mission, a lavishly decorated building that serves as both her residence and her base of operations. She is a creature of luxury and refinement, and her evenings are often spent entertaining influential guests or attending high-society events.

**Possible Quest Lines:**

***Chapter 1: Before the Uprising (1342)***

- **The Grain Monopoly:** Яна learns that a cartel of Hanseatic merchants in Reval is manipulating grain prices, hurting Novgorodian traders. She hires the player to gather evidence of their price-fixing, which may involve breaking into the Great Guild Hall to steal ledgers or intimidating a merchant's clerk for information.
- **A Gift for the Viceroy:** To curry favor with the Danish Viceroy, Яна commissions a priceless icon from Goytan. She tasks the player with acquiring the rare materials needed—lapis lazuli from a smuggler in the harbor and gold leaf from a reclusive goldsmith in the Lower Town—and ensuring the icon is delivered securely to Toompea Castle.
- **Whispers from the West:** Яна has heard rumors that the Livonian Order is secretly fortifying its castles along the Pskov border, a violation of their treaty. She sends the player, under the guise of a fur trapper, to scout the area around Vastseliina Castle and bring back proof of the Order's military buildup.

***Chapter 2: During the Uprising (1343-1345)***

- **A Profitable Rebellion:** With German vassals being slaughtered in the countryside, Яна sees an opportunity. She tasks the player with traveling through the war-torn lands of Harju County to secure ownership of abandoned manors and properties using forged documents she provides. This will require the player to evade both rebel warbands and patrols from the Livonian Order.
- **The Pskov Gambit:** The Estonian rebels have sent envoys to Pskov for military aid. Fearing a wider war that would disrupt trade, Яна sends the player to Pskov to intercept these envoys or bribe Pskovian officials to delay their response. This puts the player in direct opposition to Михаил Коловрат, who is trying to rally support for the rebellion.
- **The Swedish Question:** When news arrives that the rebels have also appealed to the Swedish bailiffs in Turku and Vyborg, Яна becomes alarmed. She sees Swedish intervention as a grave threat to Novgorod's dominance in the Baltic. The player is tasked with a risky sea voyage to intercept the Swedish fleet or deliver misinformation that discourages them from landing troops at Reval.
- **Siegebreaker:** During the Siege of Reval, Яна's trade operations are crippled. She hires the player to smuggle a valuable cargo of furs and wax out of the besieged city and deliver messages to her network of agents, ensuring Novgorod's commercial interests are protected no matter who wins the conflict.

**Political Views:**
- **On Moscow:** She views the Grand Duchy of Moscow with deep suspicion and contempt. She sees their ambition to "gather the Russian lands" as a direct threat to Novgorod's republican traditions and independence. She will actively work to undermine Moscow's influence, using trade, diplomacy, and espionage to counter their expansionist policies.
- **On Pskov:** She sees Pskov as a rebellious younger brother, foolishly asserting its independence when it should be standing with Novgorod against external threats. While she will not hesitate to use force or coercion to bring Pskov back into the fold, she would prefer to do so through political manipulation, seeing an open war as a waste of resources.
- **On the Golden Horde:** She views the Horde as a necessary evil. While she resents their overlordship, she is pragmatic enough to understand that they can be used as a tool to keep Moscow in check. She will not hesitate to use Novgorod's wealth to influence the Khan's court, playing the great powers against each other for her city's benefit.
- **On the Livonian Order:** She sees the Order as a constant and dangerous threat on her western border. They are religious fanatics and military rivals who seek to control the Baltic trade routes. She will use both overt and covert means to weaken the Order, supporting their enemies and exploiting any internal divisions.
- **On the Hanseatic League:** A necessary partner and a constant rival. She respects their economic power and understands the importance of the Hanseatic trade network for Novgorod's prosperity. However, she will always seek to gain an advantage in negotiations, viewing the German merchants as competitors to be outmaneuvered.
- **On the Kingdom of Denmark:** A paper tiger. She sees the Danish crown as a weak and ineffective ruler, unable to control its own vassals. She views the sale of Estonia as a sign of their desperation and an opportunity for Novgorod to expand its influence in the region.
