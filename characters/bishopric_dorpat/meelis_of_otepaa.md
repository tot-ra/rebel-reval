# Meelis of Otepää

A charismatic and battle-hardened Estonian rebel leader from the southern part of the bishopric. He is fiercely dedicated to driving out the German and Danish overlords. He views Bishop Johann as just another foreign tyrant and is willing to ally with the Pskovians, seeing them as the lesser of two evils, if it means a chance at freedom for his people.
