# Klaus von Rutenberg

A wealthy Hanseatic merchant whose business interests span from Novgorod to LÃ¼beck. While his main residence is in Dorpat, he frequently travels to Reval to oversee his operations at the bustling harbor and to negotiate deals within the powerful guilds. The uprising and the Pskovian threat are disastrous for trade, and he can be found in either city, urging leaders to take decisive, even brutal, action to restore order. He has a network of spies and informants throughout the region and can be a valuable, if self-serving, source of intelligence.
