# Sir Matthias von LÃ¶wenwolde

A veteran knight-brother of the Livonian Order. While his primary station is near Dorpat, he is often seen in Reval at the Order's commandery in Toompea Castle, coordinating strategy or engaging in the subtle political maneuvering the Order is known for. He is outwardly a pious and disciplined warrior, but in reality, he is a cynical and ambitious man who serves the Order's interests above all else. He offers military aid to the Bishop, but his price is always steep: more land, more influence, and a tighter grip for the Order on the bishopric's affairs.
