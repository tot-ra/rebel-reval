# Brother Andreas

A learned monk and scholar from the Dorpat Cathedral School. He occasionally travels to Reval to study at the Cathedral of Saint Mary or to meet with fellow scholars. He is one of the few who is genuinely interested in the local Estonian language and culture, seeing it not as pagan foolishness but as something worthy of study. He is torn between his loyalty to the Church and his sympathy for the plight of the common people, making him a potential secret ally for a player character who chooses a more diplomatic path.

## Visual Description

Brother Andreas is a man in his early thirties, with a lean, thoughtful build that suggests a life spent in libraries rather than on training grounds. His hair is a dark brown, tonsured in the monastic style, and his eyes are a deep, compassionate brown that seem to observe everything with a quiet intensity. He has the pale complexion of a scholar and his hands, though clean, are often stained with ink. He wears the simple, undyed brown wool habit of his order, tied at the waist with a rope belt. His movements are calm and deliberate, a stark contrast to the brusque, martial bearing of the knights and even the Prince-Bishop.

## Motivations

*   **Pursuit of Knowledge:** Andreas is a true scholar, driven by a deep curiosity about the world. He is particularly fascinated by the Estonian language and folklore, believing that understanding it is key to a true and lasting conversion, rather than one imposed by the sword.
*   **Compassion and Justice:** He is troubled by the brutality he sees around him. He believes the Church's mission should be to save souls and ease suffering, not to oppress the local population for political and economic gain.
*   **Preservation:** He fears that the uprising and the Order's brutal response will result in the complete destruction of the local culture. He secretly works to document and preserve what he can before it is lost forever.

## Ties & Relationships

*   **Allies:** He has a small circle of like-minded scholars in both Dorpat and Reval. He has also earned the cautious trust of a few Estonian elders and traders who recognize his genuine interest and respect for their ways.
*   **Enemies:** While he has no personal enemies, his views would be considered dangerously heretical by hardliners in the Livonian Order. If his activities were discovered, men like Sir Matthias von Löwenwolde would see him as a traitor and a threat to the stability of the crusader states.
*   **Initial View of Main Player:** He will be reserved but observant, trying to gauge the player's character. If the player shows curiosity, compassion, or an open mind, Andreas may cautiously reveal his true interests and become a valuable source of information and unique quests that offer alternatives to bloodshed.

## History (Biography)

Andreas was born in Lübeck to a merchant family, but his quiet, scholarly nature led him to the church rather than the counting house. His sharp intellect earned him a place at the University of Paris, where he was exposed to the great philosophical and theological debates of the age. Filled with a missionary zeal tempered by humanist ideals, he volunteered for service in Livonia, hoping to participate in the conversion of the last pagans in Europe. The harsh reality of the crusader state—a land of conquest and oppression—has since challenged his youthful idealism, setting him on a more complicated and dangerous path.

## Daily Routines

His life is governed by the monastic hours of prayer. Between services, he spends nearly all his time in the cathedral school and its library. He teaches Latin and theology to novices in the morning. His afternoons are dedicated to his private work: meticulously copying manuscripts, studying captured pagan artifacts, and secretly meeting with local contacts to learn their language and stories. He often works late into the night, his candle the only light in the quiet scriptorium.

## Possible Quest Lines

*   **The Lost Verse:** Andreas has heard rumors of an Estonian elder who knows a piece of an ancient epic poem. He asks the player to find this person and persuade them to share the story, which must be done without attracting the attention of the Order.
*   **A Just Bargain:** An Estonian farmer is accused of witchcraft after a dispute with a German vassal. Andreas believes the man is innocent and asks the player to find evidence to clear his name before he is executed.
*   **Sanctuary:** A young rebel is wounded and seeks sanctuary in the cathedral. Andreas hides him and tasks the player with smuggling him out of the city before the Order's patrols discover him, a direct act of defiance against the ruling powers.
