A weaver in the Weavers' Collective.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

A woman in her late 20s, with a slender but strong build from years of working the loom. Her hair is the color of straw, long and tied back in a simple braid. Her eyes are a clear, bright blue. She wears a simple, homespun linen dress in a faded shade of green, and a leather apron to protect it from the dust and grime of the workshop. Her hands are calloused and nimble, her fingers stained with dye.

### History

Liina was born and raised in the eastern quarter of Reval, the daughter of a weaver and a fisherman. She learned her mother's trade at a young age, and has been working at the Weavers' Collective since she was a girl. She is a quiet and observant woman, with a sharp wit and a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely loyal to her friends and family, and has a deep-seated resentment for the wealthy merchants and nobles who control the city.

### Motivations

Liina is motivated by a desire for a better life for herself and her community. She dreams of a day when the workers of Reval will be treated with dignity and respect, and when the wealth of the city will be shared more equitably. She is a secret supporter of the rebellion, and uses her position at the Weavers' Collective to gather information and spread dissent.
