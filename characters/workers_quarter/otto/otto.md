### Visual Description

Otto is a man in his late forties, with a thin, wiry frame and a perpetually grim expression. His face is pale and pockmarked, and his eyes are small, dark, and constantly darting about, as if searching for movement in the shadows. His hair is greasy and lank, and he has a patchy, unkempt beard. He wears a collection of mismatched, ragged clothing, covered in stains and smelling of the sewers.

### Motivations

- **To Survive:** Otto's primary motivation is simple survival. His job is dangerous and his pay is meager, but it is the only life he knows.
- **To Be Left Alone:** Otto is a man who has been shunned by society, and he has come to prefer the company of rats to that of people.
- **To Find a Glimmer of Beauty in the Squalor:** Despite his grim existence, Otto occasionally finds a strange sort of beauty in the hidden, forgotten corners of the city.

### Ties & Relationships

- **Allies:**
    - **His ferrets:** Otto's only true companions are his trained ferrets, which he uses to flush rats from their hiding places.
- **Enemies:**
    - **The city's rat population:** Otto is locked in a constant, bloody war with the city's rats.
    - **The rest of the city:** Most of the city's residents view Otto with a mixture of disgust and fear, and they avoid him whenever possible.
- **Initial View of the Main Player:** Otto is suspicious and hostile towards the player, seeing them as just another person who will look down on him.

### History (Biography)

No one knows where Otto came from, or how he came to be the city's rat catcher. He is a man without a past, a ghost who haunts the city's sewers and alleyways. He is a man who has been stripped of everything but his name and his grim determination to survive.

### Daily Routines

- **Day:** Otto spends his days in the city's dark and filthy underbelly, hunting rats.
- **Evening:** In the evenings, he can be found in his hovel, skinning his catch and preparing his meager meal.
