# Gustav

A strong and silent brick maker, his body hardened by years of toil.

### Visual Description

Gustav is a man in his late thirties, with a powerful, muscular build from a lifetime of heavy labor. His face is perpetually smudged with soot and clay, and his hands are rough and calloused. He has short, dark hair and his eyes are a deep, serious brown. He wears simple, practical clothes: a heavy linen shirt and trousers, and sturdy leather boots.
