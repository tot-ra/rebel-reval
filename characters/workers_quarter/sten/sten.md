# Sten

A quiet, solitary woodcutter with a powerful build and a deep connection to the forest.

### Visual Description

Sten is a man in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built, with broad shoulders and muscular arms honed by years of swinging an axe. He has a thick, untamed brown beard and long brown hair that he often ties back with a leather cord. His eyes are a deep green, the color of the forest canopy. He is dressed in practical, hard-wearing clothes: a simple linen tunic, leather breeches, and worn boots. His face is weathered and tanned from his time spent outdoors.

### Motivations

- **To Live a Simple, Unfettered Life:** Sten prefers the solitude of the forest to the noise and crowds of the city. He values his independence and freedom above all else.
- **To Provide for His Small Family:** While he is a man of few needs, Sten works hard to provide for his wife and young son.
- **To Protect the Ancient Woods:** Sten has a deep respect for the forest and its traditions. He is wary of those who would exploit it for their own gain.

### Ties & Relationships

- **Allies:**
    - **The local herbalist:** Sten often trades firewood for remedies and poultices from the local herbalist.
- **Enemies:**
    - **The city's charcoal burners:** Sten sees the charcoal burners as a threat to the forest, as they consume vast quantities of wood.
- **Initial View of the Main Player:** Sten is a man of few words and is initially distrustful of outsiders. However, he will respect the player if they show a similar respect for the natural world.

### History (Biography)

Sten was born and raised in a small village outside of Reval, where he learned the ways of the forest from his father. He moved to the city as a young man, but he has never truly left the woods behind. He is a man of the old ways, and he is more comfortable with the rustle of leaves than the chatter of the marketplace.

### Daily Routines

- **Day:** Sten spends his days in the forests outside the city walls, felling trees and hauling wood back to his shack.
- **Evening:** In the evenings, he can be found at home, sharing a simple meal with his family.
