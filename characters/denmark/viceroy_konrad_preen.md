# Viceroy Konrad Preen

**Visual Description:** A weary, aging diplomat in his late 50s. His face is lined with the stress of his position, and his eyes often seem distant, lost in thoughts of a comfortable retirement. He dresses in fine but practical Danish attire, suitable for his station as governor, though perhaps a bit worn from his long tenure in this northern outpost. He carries himself with an air of pragmatism, his movements economical and his posture slightly stooped from years of leaning over maps and documents.
