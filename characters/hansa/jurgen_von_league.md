# JÃ¼rgen von League

**Visual Description:** A wealthy and ruthless amber merchant. He is sharply dressed in the latest fashions of the Hanseatic League, his clothes made of rich fabrics and adorned with subtle but expensive jewelry. He has a piercing gaze and a confident, almost arrogant, posture. His hands are well-manicured, a stark contrast to the rough hands of the laborers he employs. He often carries a polished amber stone, which he turns over in his fingers while in thought.
