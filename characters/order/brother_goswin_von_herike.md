![alt text](brother_goswin.png)

**Visual Description:**
Brother Goswin von Herike is a man in his early 40s, with a robust and stocky build that speaks of a life of martial discipline. His face is broad and weathered, with a square jaw and a prominent brow. He has close-cropped, light brown hair and intelligent, watchful brown eyes. A thick, well-groomed mustache adorns his upper lip, a common style among the German knights of the era. His expression is typically serious and focused, that of a man accustomed to command and responsibility.

He is dressed in the practical attire of a high-ranking member of the Livonian Order. Over a simple linen shirt, he wears a chainmail hauberk, its steel rings polished and well-maintained. Over the chainmail, he wears a white surcoat, shorter than the ceremonial mantle, made of durable wool and emblazoned with the black cross of the Order. The surcoat is functional, allowing for ease of movement in combat. He wears sturdy leather breeches and tall, thick-soled leather boots. A wide leather belt with a simple iron buckle cinches his waist, from which hangs a sheathed longsword.

**Motivations:**
Goswin von Herike is a man of ambition and duty. He is deeply loyal to the Livonian Order and its mission, but he is also a pragmatist who understands the importance of power and influence. His primary motivation is to rise within the ranks of the Order and leave his mark on its history. He is a skilled administrator and a capable military commander, and he is eager to prove his worth to his superiors. The St. George's Night Uprising is, for him, both a threat and an opportunityâ€”a chance to demonstrate his leadership and crush the enemies of the Order.

**Ties & Relationships:**
*   **Allies:** As the Commander of Viljandi, he has the loyalty of the knights and soldiers under his command. He has a respectful, if somewhat formal, relationship with [Master Burchard von Dreileben](master_burchard_von_dreileben.md) , whom he sees as a mentor and a role model. He also cultivates relationships with other influential commanders within the Order.
*   **Enemies:** His primary enemies are the Estonian rebels, whom he views with a mixture of contempt and frustration. He also sees the Danish nobility and the Hanseatic merchants as rivals, though he is more willing than Master von Dreileben to engage in diplomacy and negotiation with them if it serves his purposes.
*   **Initial View of the Main Player:** He would see the main player as a potential asset or a potential threat. If the player demonstrates skill and loyalty, he would be willing to take them under his wing and use them to further his own ambitions. However, if he suspects the player of disloyalty, he would not hesitate to eliminate them.
