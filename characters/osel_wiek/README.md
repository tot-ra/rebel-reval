# Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek

## History and Political Situation (1340-1345)

The Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek was a semi-independent Roman Catholic prince-bishopric within Terra Mariana (Old Livonia) and the Holy Roman Empire. During 1340-1345, the bishopric was ruled by **Bishop Burchard von Dreileben**. This period was marked by significant political instability and regional conflicts. A major event was the St. George's Night Uprising in 1343, a large-scale rebellion by the native Estonian population against foreign rule. The uprising, though primarily centered in Harria and Vironia, had a profound impact on the entire region, including Ösel–Wiek, leading to increased tensions and military actions by the Livonian Order to suppress the revolt.
