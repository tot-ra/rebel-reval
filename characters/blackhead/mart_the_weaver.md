### "A city is like a tapestry. Pull one thread, and the whole pattern unravels."

![alt text](../../skills/image.png)

**Visual Description for Image Generation:**
**Overall Appearance:** Mart is a man in his early fifties, with a stocky, powerful build from a lifetime spent working a loom. He has a grounded, steady presence, and his movements are patient and deliberate. He often has a thoughtful, almost distant expression, as if contemplating the intricate patterns of his craft.

**Face & Hair:** He has a broad, weathered face with kind, deep-set blue eyes that have seen much. His light brown hair, streaked with grey, is tied back in a simple knot. A thick, well-kept beard and mustache frame a firm mouth. His hands are calloused and strong, with fingers surprisingly nimble from years of weaving.

**Clothing & Colors:** Mart wears practical, well-made clothes befitting an artisan. His primary garment is a knee-length tunic of undyed, light brown wool, belted at the waist with a simple leather cord. Over this, he wears a darker brown, sleeveless vest of a coarser, more durable weave. His trousers are a simple, dark grey linen, tucked into sturdy leather work boots. The colors are earthy and natural—browns, greys, and off-whites—reflecting his connection to his craft and his humble origins.

**Accessories:** He wears no jewelry, save for a small, carved wooden bird tied to his belt, a memento from his childhood. He sometimes carries a small, sharp knife for cutting threads, tucked into his belt.

**Motivations:**
Mart's primary motivation is the preservation of Estonian culture and identity within the bustling, German-dominated city of Reval. He sees the Brotherhood of Blackheads not as a path to riches, but as a necessary shield against the cultural erosion brought by foreign powers. He believes that by gaining influence within the merchant class, he can protect Estonian artisans, preserve their traditions, and ensure that the city's prosperity benefits its native inhabitants as well. His secret goal is to create a network of Estonian craftsmen who can act as a subtle, internal resistance, using their skills and knowledge to support the rebellion in quiet, practical ways.

**Ties & Relationships:**
- **Allies:** He is a respected figure among the Estonian artisans of the lower town, who see him as a mentor and a protector. He has a quiet understanding with some of the more moderate members of the "Black Cloaks," providing them with information and supplies when he can.
- **Enemies:** He is deeply distrustful of the Livonian Order and the more arrogant members of the Hanseatic League, whom he sees as threats to his people's way of life. He is cautious around Johann von Minden, recognizing the man's ambition but wary of his ultimate goals.
- **Kalev (The Player):** Mart sees in Kalev a reflection of his own younger, more fiery self. He will act as a mentor to the player, offering guidance, wisdom, and practical support. He will try to temper Kalev's impulsiveness, urging him to think strategically and to understand that a city can be changed not just by the sword, but by the slow, patient work of many hands.

**History:**
Born in a small village in Harju County, Mart learned the art of weaving from his mother. When his village was destroyed in a raid by the Livonian Order, he fled to Reval with nothing but the clothes on his back and the skills in his hands. He found work as an apprentice to a German weaver, quickly surpassing his master in skill and artistry. He joined the Brotherhood of Blackheads as a way to gain the status and protection necessary to start his own workshop. Over the years, he has become a master of his craft, his tapestries sought after by merchants and nobles alike. But he has never forgotten his roots, and he uses his position to help other Estonian artisans find their footing in the city.

**Daily Routines:**
Mart spends most of his days in his workshop in the lower town, a cozy, cluttered space filled with the scent of wool and dye. He rises with the sun and works at his loom until dusk, his hands in constant, rhythmic motion. In the evenings, he can often be found at a quiet tavern, sharing a drink with other artisans and listening to the news and gossip of the city. He sleeps in a small room above his workshop, surrounded by the tools of his trade.

**Possible Quest Lines:**
- **The Weaver's Network:** Mart asks the player to help him build a network of Estonian artisans, delivering messages, gathering materials, and protecting them from the city guard.
- **A Banner for the Rebellion:** Mart has been secretly commissioned to create a banner for the Harju Kings. He needs the player to acquire the rare dyes and threads needed for the task, a dangerous mission that will take them into the heart of enemy territory.
- **The Tapestry of Lies:** Mart has woven a tapestry that contains a hidden message, a warning to the rebels about an impending attack. He needs the player to deliver the tapestry to a contact in the countryside, without arousing the suspicion of the Livonian Order.
