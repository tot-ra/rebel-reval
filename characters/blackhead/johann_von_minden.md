### "Reval is not a castle of knights or a den of peasants. It is a city of coin, and coin has no king but its master."

**Visual Description for Image Generation:**
**Overall Appearance:** Johann von Minden is a man in his late thirties, presenting a facade of effortless charisma that masks a sharp, calculating intellect. He is lean and tall, with a straight, confident posture that speaks to his authority as a leader. His movements are deliberate and graceful, never rushed.

**Face & Hair:** He has a narrow face with high cheekbones, a strong jawline, and a prominent, straight nose. His eyes are a cool, piercing grey, often holding a hint of amusement. His dark brown hair is cut short and neatly combed, and his face is always clean-shaven. A thin, pale scar cuts across his left cheekbone, a subtle hint at a more dangerous past.

**Clothing & Colors:** Johann is always impeccably dressed in the attire of the Brotherhood of Blackheads, but with personalized, expensive touches. He wears a high-collared, tailored robe of deep black wool that falls to his ankles. The collar and cuffs are adorned with intricate silver embroidery in a geometric pattern, catching the light subtly. Underneath, he wears a fine linen shirt of pristine white, the collar just visible at his throat. A dark leather belt with a polished silver buckle cinches his robe at the waist. He wears soft, black leather boots that are well-maintained but practical. The dominant colors are black, silver, and a stark white accent, creating a look of sober elegance and wealth.

**Accessories:** His only piece of jewelry is a heavy silver signet ring on his right index finger, bearing the coat of arms of his merchant family from Minden. He carries no visible weapons, relying on his wit and influence instead.

**Motivations:**
Johann's primary motivation is to see Reval evolve into a free city-state, governed by merchants, for merchants. He views the Livonian Order as an archaic institution, a relic of a bygone era of feudalism that stifles economic growth and innovation. He believes that true power lies not in land or titles, but in the flow of capital. His secret agenda is to methodically dismantle the Order's influence from within the city walls, using the Brotherhood of Blackheads as his instrument. He seeks to create a new republic on the Baltic coast, a hub of trade and enlightenment that answers to no king or bishop, only to the laws of the market.

**Ties & Relationships:**
- **Allies:** He maintains a fragile alliance with certain guilds and influential members of the Hanseatic League who share his vision of a merchant-led future. He is a master of cultivating informants and has ears in every corner of the city, from the docks to the Domberg.
- **Enemies:** His chief adversary is the Commander of the Livonian Order in Reval, whom he sees as the primary obstacle to his plans. He is also wary of the more radical elements among the Estonian rebels, viewing their chaotic uprising as a threat to the stability and order necessary for trade. He plays a dangerous game, publicly cooperating with the Order while secretly undermining their authority.
- **Kalev (The Player):** Johann sees Kalev not as a hero or a villain, but as a valuable, albeit unpredictable, asset. He recognizes the smith's unusual strength and potential influence over the common folk. He will attempt to manipulate Kalev, offering coin, status, and protection in exchange for services that align with his own goals, all while keeping his true intentions hidden behind a veneer of shared interest.

**History:**
Born the third son of a minor merchant family in Minden, Johann was sent to Reval as a young man to make his own fortune. Lacking the inheritance of his elder brothers, he possessed a sharper mind and a more ruthless ambition. He quickly distinguished himself within the Brotherhood of Blackheads, not through brute force, but through his uncanny ability to mediate disputes, forge profitable trade agreements, and anticipate the moves of his rivals. He rose through the ranks with a combination of charm, bribery, and blackmail, eliminating his opponents with surgical precision. His leadership of the Brotherhood is the culmination of a lifetime spent clawing his way to the top, and he will stop at nothing to achieve his ultimate vision for Reval.
