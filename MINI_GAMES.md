# Mini-Game Ideas

This document outlines potential mini-games to be included in "Reval Rebel." These are designed to enhance the core gameplay loops of crafting, rebellion, and exploration.

## Player-Suggested Ideas

### Castle Building
- **Concept:** A strategic mini-game where the player can manage and upgrade a small stronghold or a hidden rebel base. This could involve gathering resources, recruiting followers, and building defenses.
- **Integration:** Could be tied to the **Rebel Morale** meter. A well-defended base could provide a significant boost to Hope. It could also serve as a hub for rebel missions.

### Pirate Ship
- **Concept:** A naval-themed mini-game focusing on the Hanseatic trade routes. The player could command a small ship to engage in trade, piracy, or smuggling along the coast.
- **Integration:** This could be a major late-game feature, allowing the player to disrupt Hanseatic trade, thus increasing **Chaos** and impacting the city's economy. It could also open up new locations to explore.

### Catching Fish on a Ship
- **Concept:** A relaxing, skill-based fishing mini-game that can be played from the docks of Reval or from a boat. Different fish could be caught depending on the location, time of day, and season.
- **Integration:** Provides a source of food and income. Rare fish could be used in pagan rituals or sold for a high price. This fits well with the day-to-day life of a resident of Reval.

## Additional Recommendations

### Tavern Brawling
- **Concept:** A simple, physics-based fighting mini-game in the city's taverns. Could be triggered by dialogue choices or specific events.
- **Integration:** A way to increase **Chaos**, earn a reputation, or intimidate NPCs for information. Winning could earn you respect from certain factions.

### Smuggling Run
- **Concept:** A stealth-based mini-game where the player must transport illicit goods (weapons for rebels, forbidden texts, etc.) through the city at night, avoiding guard patrols.
- **Integration:** Directly supports the "Rebel Path" and "Ruler Path" (as an interception mission). Success could increase **Rebel Morale** or provide valuable resources.

### Market Haggling
- **Concept:** A dialogue-based mini-game where the player negotiates prices for goods they are buying or selling. This could involve reading the merchant's mood and making counter-offers.
- **Integration:** Enhances the "Crafting & Commerce" loop. Successful haggling could lead to better profits, which can be used to fund other activities.

### Ritual Chanting
- **Concept:** A rhythm-based mini-game performed at sacred groves or other pagan sites. The player would need to match chants or drum beats to successfully complete a ritual.
- **Integration:** Tied to the pagan abilities and the **Chaos** meter. Successful rituals could grant powerful, temporary boons or even cause supernatural events to occur in the city.

### Herbalism & Alchemy
- **Concept:** A gathering and crafting mini-game focused on the natural world. The player could gather herbs, mushrooms, and other reagents from the forests and groves outside the city to craft potions, poisons, and ritual components.
- **Integration:** Provides another layer to the crafting system and supports both combat (poisons, healing potions) and the pagan storyline (ritual components).
