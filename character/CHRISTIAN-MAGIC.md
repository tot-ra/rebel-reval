# 🙏 Divine Rites: The New Faith

Theurgy, often called "Miracles," is the power of the divine made manifest in the mortal world. Practitioners do not wield power themselves, but act as conduits for a higher authority—be it God, the saints, or the celestial host. It is an art of faith, devotion, and supplication.

The core of this magic is **divine intervention**. A priest or holy warrior does not command the elements, but petitions for aid. Their strength of faith determines the potency of the miracle granted. This magic is structured, orderly, and bound by the strict doctrines of the Church, reflecting a divinely ordained and unchanging cosmic order.

## The Elements of the New Faith

These are the fundamental concepts that a Christian practitioner can master.

### Christian Elements
*   ⚖️ **Order (Kord):** The divine law and structure of the universe.
*   🙏 **Faith (Usk):** The cornerstone of this school, representing belief and devotion.
*   ✨ **Hope (Lootus):** Divine inspiration and resilience against despair.
*   👑 **Dominion (Valdus):** The divine right to rule and control, granted from above.
*   💔 **Sacrifice (Ohver):** Martyrdom and self-denial for a higher, divine cause.
*   💡 **Light (Valgus):** A new element representing divine light, purity, and truth.
*   ⚖️ **Judgment (Kohtumõistmine):** A new element representing divine wrath and justice.

### Neutral & Shared Elements
These are abstract concepts that can be wielded by practitioners of either school of thought.
*   ⏳ **Time (Aeg):** A universal constant.
*   🧠 **Mind (Mõistus):** Thought and reason are accessible to all.
*   🔗 **Metal (Metall):** Represents craft and defense, neutral concepts.
*   🎭 **Deception (Pettus):** Can be used for pagan trickery or "pious frauds."
*   😱 **Fear (Hirm):** A universal emotion that can be invoked by both primal dread and divine terror.

## 🙏 The Rites of Power: Performing Miracles

Miracles are not forged through experimentation, but performed through established **rites and prayers**. The combinations of Elements are fixed and must be learned from religious tutors, sacred texts, or through divine revelation.

Instead of a flexible "spellforging" system, this divine art uses a more rigid structure. Combining `Faith`, `Order`, and `Fire` will always result in the "Blade of Judgment," a specific, pre-defined miracle. The power of these miracles scales not with the user's will, but with their **Piety**, a measure of their devotion and standing with the divine.

### The Path of Martyrdom
A core tenet of the New Faith is sacrifice. Some of the most powerful rites require the practitioner to offer their own life force, suffering pain or injury to channel overwhelming divine power. This path is not for the faint of heart, but for the truly devout, martyrdom is the ultimate expression of faith, and its rewards can be immense. A character who walks this path may find themselves able to turn the tide of battle at great personal cost.

## 🛡️ Rites of Endowment: Imbuing Armor and Shields

Beyond performing miracles in the heat of battle, devout followers can perform **Rites of Endowment** to imbue their armor and shields with lasting divine power. These blessings are not temporary buffs, but persistent enchantments that grant holy properties to the equipment. This is a time-consuming ritual that requires intense prayer and focus, often performed in a consecrated place like a chapel or monastery.

The effects are subtle but powerful, reflecting the protective and resilient nature of the faith.

| Sequence | Rite of Endowment | Effect on Armor/Shield |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Faith` + `Order` | **Rune of Sanctity** | The equipment becomes consecrated, slightly reducing damage taken from undead and demonic sources. |
| `Faith` + `Hope` | **Sigil of Resilience** | The wearer's resolve is hardened, granting a small amount of passive stamina regeneration. |
| `Order` + `Metal` | **Mark of Temperance** | The armor becomes exceptionally sturdy, increasing its durability and reducing the effectiveness of armor-degrading effects. |
| `Sacrifice` + `Light` | **Blessing of the Martyr** | The armor gains a reactive property. When the wearer's health drops below a critical threshold, it releases a burst of healing light. |
| `Judgment` + `Fire` | **Imbuement of Retribution** | When the wearer blocks an attack, the shield has a chance to erupt with holy fire, damaging the attacker. |
| `Hope` + `Air` | **Grace of the Swift** | The armor feels lighter than it is, slightly reducing the stamina cost of dodging. |
| `Faith` + `Earth` | **Foundation of Stone** | The wearer becomes more difficult to stagger or knock down. |
