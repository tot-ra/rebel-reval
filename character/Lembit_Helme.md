- **Enemies:** Livonian Order knights, German vassals, Hanseatic merchants of Reval, Danish officials

## History (Biography)
Born in Harju County to a peasant family, Lembit witnessed generations of German exploitation. His father was killed by a Livonian knight for refusing to pay excessive taxes. He learned to read and write from a local priest, which made him a rare educated peasant. He became a village elder, mediating disputes and organizing resistance. During the St. George's Night Uprising, he was one of the four elected "kings" and led the Harju rebels until his capture at Paide Castle.
