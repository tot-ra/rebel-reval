# üîÆ The Elements of Philosophy

Magic in Reval is not about chanting arcane words, but about imposing one's philosophical will upon reality. The world is shaped by the interplay of fundamental concepts, but how a practitioner accesses this power depends on their beliefs. Magic is divided into two distinct schools of thought: the raw, personal power of **Pagan Magic**, and the divine, structured **Divine Rites**.

## Two Schools of Thought

The path a mage chooses will fundamentally alter how they interact with the world and the very nature of their power.

### üå≥ [Pagan Magic: The Old Ways](PAGAN-MAGIC.md)
Pagan magic is the art of **direct control**. It is an animistic and personal philosophy, viewing the world as filled with spirits and raw power that can be commanded through sheer force of will. Practitioners forge their own spells by combining elements in a flexible, creative system, detailed in the full document.

### üôè [Divine Rites: The New Faith](CHRISTIAN-MAGIC.md)
The art of **divine intervention** is a theurgical and structured philosophy, viewing power as a gift from a higher authority. Practitioners do not command magic but are granted miracles through faith and devotion. Their abilities include performing established rites and prayers, as well as imbuing equipment with holy power.

## üî® The Smith's Soul: The Hammer as a Conduit

For Kalev, the protagonist, the act of wielding power is uniquely tied to his identity as a smith. His hammer is not merely a tool or weapon; it is a conduit for his will and a symbol of his craft. This allows him to interact with both magical schools in a way no other practitioner can.

*   **Forging Rites:** When performing Divine Rites, Kalev's hammer can serve as a holy symbol. The act of striking an anvil or even the ground can be a form of prayer, shaping divine energy as he would shape metal. The hammer symbolizes order, creation, and the power to impose a righteous design upon the world, echoing God as the divine craftsman.
*   **Forging Spells:** When using Pagan Magic, the hammer is a tool to directly impose his will on the raw elements. Striking a stone to summon an earth wall or quenching a hot blade in water to create a healing mist are intuitive acts for him. The hammer becomes an extension of his intent, allowing him to physically beat reality into the shape he desires.

This unique connection allows Kalev to bridge the gap between the two schools, using the universal language of the forge to channel vastly different powers.

## üî• The Inner Forge: From Aspect to Element

Regardless of the path chosen, the power of your abilities is a direct reflection of your inner self, as defined by the **[NATURAL character build system](BUILD.md)**. Each point you invest into one of the seven aspects of your soul directly empowers the magical elements associated with it.

**The Rule of Power:** For every point in a given Aspect, the damage and effectiveness of its associated Elements are increased by **2%**.

This creates a vital link between your character's growth and your magical prowess. A high **Tenacity** not only makes you a formidable warrior but also a devastating pyromancer. A high **Awareness** not only makes you perceptive but also a master of time and thought.

Here is the breakdown of which Aspects empower which Elements:

-   **Nature:** Empowers `Earth` and `Metal`.
-   **Affection:** Empowers `Water` and `Air`.
-   **Tenacity:** Empowers `Fire` and `Beast`.
-   **Unity:** Empowers `Life` and `Hope`.
-   **Resonance:** Empowers `Deception` and `Dominion`.
-   **Awareness:** Empowers `Mind` and `Time`.
-   **Light:** Empowers `Faith` and `Spirit`.

## Spell Lists

The fundamental effects of combining one or two elements are universal. However, the most powerful three-element combinations are closely guarded secrets taught by the various factions, and are unique to either the Pagan or Christian schools.

*(The full list of Pure Element Spells and general Two-Element combinations can be found in the appendix of the main rulebook or relevant game guides.)*
