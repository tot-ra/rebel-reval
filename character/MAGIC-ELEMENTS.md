## 🔮 The Elements of Philosophy

Magic in Reval is not about chanting arcane words, but about imposing one's philosophical will upon reality. The world is shaped by the interplay of fundamental concepts. By mastering these **Elements of Philosophy**, Kalev can forge his own spells and actions.

There are 21 known Elements, grouped into three domains. While Kalev can learn to understand all of them, he can only hold 8 in his mind at any given time (mapped to QWER/ASDF keys).

#### Primal & Metaphysical Elements
*   🌱 **Life (Elu):** Growth, healing, vitality.
*   💀 **Death (Surm):** Decay, finality, undeath.
*   👻 **Spirit (Hing):** The soul, ghosts, ethereal forces.
*   ⏳ **Time (Aeg):** Haste, slowness, causality.
*   🌀 **Chaos (Kaos):** Unpredictability, randomness, entropy.
*   ⚖️ **Order (Kord):** Structure, law, predictability.
*   🧠 **Mind (Mõistus):** Thought, reason, psionics.

#### Natural & Worldly Elements

*   💧 **Water (Vesi):** Change, cleansing, depth.
*   🌍 **Earth (Maa):** Stability, nature, strength.

## 🔥 The Inner Forge: From Aspect to Element

The power of your forged spells is a direct reflection of your inner self, as defined by the **[NATURAL character build system](BUILD.md)**. Each point you invest into one of the seven aspects of your soul directly empowers the magical elements associated with it.

**The Rule of Power:** For every point in a given Aspect, the damage and effectiveness of its associated Elements are increased by **2%**.

This creates a vital link between your character's growth and your magical prowess. A high **Tenacity** not only makes you a formidable warrior but also a devastating pyromancer. A high **Awareness** not only makes you perceptive but also a master of time and thought.

Here is the breakdown of which Aspects empower which Elements:

-   **Nature:** Empowers `Earth` and `Metal`.
-   **Affection:** Empowers `Water` and `Air`.
-   **Tenacity:** Empowers `Fire` and `Beast`.
-   **Unity:** Empowers `Life` and `Hope`.
-   **Resonance:** Empowers `Deception` and `Dominion`.
-   **Awareness:** Empowers `Mind` and `Time`.
-   **Light:** Empowers `Faith` and `Spirit`.

##  blacksmithing: Forging Spells

Spells are not learned from tomes, but **forged** by combining Elements in a sequence of up to 4. The order and combination of Elements determine the final effect. The first Element in the sequence defines the spell's core **intent** or delivery method (e.g., a projectile, a self-buff, an area-of-effect), while subsequent Elements act as **modifiers**, adding properties or altering the effect.

This system allows for immense creativity and tactical flexibility. A player might enter a mission with a set of Elements focused on stealth and illusion, or go in prepared for open warfare with elements of destruction and defense.

### Pure Element Spells

When an element is used on its own, without any modifiers, it produces its most fundamental effect. These are the simplest spells to forge, but they form the building blocks of all magic.

| Element | Pure Spell | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Life` | **Mend** | A small burst of healing energy that restores a minor amount of the caster's health. |
| `Death` | **Wither** | A touch that causes a target's armor and weapons to temporarily decay, reducing their effectiveness. |
| `Spirit` | **Spirit Ward** | A brief defensive aura that reduces incoming damage from magical or ethereal sources. |
| `Time` | **Hasten** | A self-cast buff that slightly increases the caster's movement and attack speed for a few seconds. |
| `Chaos` | **Unpredictable Bolt** | A projectile that has a random effect on impact, such as a small explosion, a flash of light, or a minor curse. |
| `Order` | **Stabilize** | A self-cast buff that briefly increases resistance to being knocked down or staggered. |
| `Mind` | **Focus** | A self-cast buff that briefly reduces the Willpower cost of the next spell forged. |
| `Fire` | **Spark** | A small, fast projectile of fire that deals minor damage. |
| `Water` | **Cleanse** | A splash of water that removes one negative status effect from the caster or an ally. |
| `Earth` | **Tremor** | A small shockwave at the caster's feet that briefly staggers nearby enemies. |
| `Air` | **Gust** | A blast of wind that pushes back a single enemy. |
| `Metal` | **Reinforce** | A self-cast buff that temporarily increases the caster's armor rating. |
| `Blood` | **Bloodletting** | A targeted spell that causes a minor bleed effect, dealing damage over time. |
| `Beast` | **Primal Roar** | A shout that has a chance to cause weak enemies to hesitate for a moment. |
| `Faith` | **Blessing** | A self-cast buff that slightly increases all damage dealt for a short period. |
| `Deception` | **Distract** | Creates a sound or visual illusion at a target location to draw enemy attention. |
| `Hope` | **Rally** | A self-cast buff that restores a small amount of stamina. |
| `Fear` | **Intimidate** | A targeted debuff that slightly reduces an enemy's attack damage for a short time. |
| `Dominion` | **Mark** | A targeted debuff that makes an enemy briefly visible through walls and obstacles. |
| `Freedom` | **Unfetter** | Instantly removes any slowing or immobilizing effects from the caster. |
| `Sacrifice` | **Convert** | The caster sacrifices a small amount of health to regain a small amount of Willpower. |

### Spellforging Examples: The Power of Combination

Combining elements is the true heart of magic in Reval. While a single element produces a simple effect, combining two creates a spell of significantly greater power and utility. The most powerful and complex three-element spells are often closely guarded secrets, taught only by the various factions to their most trusted members.

#### Two-Element Spells

Here are some examples of what can be achieved by forging two elements together.

| Sequence | Forged Spell | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Fire` + `Air` | **Fireball** | A larger, explosive projectile. The Air element gives it an area of effect. |

| `Water` + `Life` | **Healing Mist** | (Area-cast) Creates a mist that heals allies who stand within it. |
| `Mind` + `Deception` | **Illusionary Double** | Creates a clone of yourself that draws enemy fire. |
| `Faith` + `Fire` | **Holy Flame** | A projectile that deals both fire and holy damage, especially effective against undead. |
| `Death` + `Spirit` | **Animate Corpse** | Raises a fallen enemy to fight for you for a limited time. |
| `Time` + `Chaos` | **Erratic Haste** | A self-cast buff that dramatically increases speed, but with a chance to stumble. |
| `Order` + `Dominion` | **Hold Person** | A targeted spell that paralyzes a single human enemy for a short duration. |

| `Blood` + `Dominion` | **Blood Bond** | Link yourself to an enemy; a portion of the damage they take is also dealt to you, but your damage against them is greatly increased. |
