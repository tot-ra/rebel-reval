# 🌳 Pagan Magic: The Old Ways

Pagan magic is the raw, untamed power that flows through the natural world. It is not a gift from a distant god, but an inherent force to be mastered through will, wisdom, and communion with the spirits of the land. Practitioners, often called shamans, sages, or simply "the knowing," see the world as alive with spirits—in the rustling leaves, the flowing rivers, and the heart of the fire.

The core of this magic is **direct control**. A pagan mage imposes their will upon reality, weaving the Elements of Philosophy together to create new effects. It is a personal, intuitive, and often chaotic art, reflecting the untamed nature of the wilderness itself.

## The Elements of the Old Ways

These are the fundamental concepts that a pagan practitioner can master.

### Pagan Elements
*   🌱 **Life (Elu):** Represents the untamed vitality of nature.
*   💀 **Death (Surm):** The natural cycle of decay and return to the earth.
*   👻 **Spirit (Hing):** The animistic belief in spirits inhabiting the world.
*   🌀 **Chaos (Kaos):** The unpredictable nature of the wild.
*   🔥 **Fire (Tuli):** A raw, destructive, and passionate force.
*   💧 **Water (Vesi):** The changing, untamed nature of rivers and seas.
*   🌍 **Earth (Maa):** The foundational strength and stability of the land.
*   💨 **Air (Õhk):** The freedom of the winds and the breath of life.
*   🩸 **Blood (Veri):** Represents lineage, sacrifice, and life force in a primal sense.
*   🐾 **Beast (Elajas):** The instinct and ferocity of the wild.
*   🕊️ **Freedom (Vabadus):** Liberation from imposed structures.

### Neutral & Shared Elements
These are abstract concepts that can be wielded by practitioners of either school of thought.
*   ⏳ **Time (Aeg):** A universal constant.
*   🧠 **Mind (Mõistus):** Thought and reason are accessible to all.
*   🔗 **Metal (Metall):** Represents craft and defense, neutral concepts.
*   🎭 **Deception (Pettus):** Can be used for pagan trickery or "pious frauds."
*   😱 **Fear (Hirm):** A universal emotion that can be invoked by both primal dread and divine terror.

## 🔥 The Inner Forge: Spellforging

Spells are not learned from tomes, but **forged** by combining Elements in a sequence of up to 4. The order and combination of Elements determine the final effect. The first Element in the sequence defines the spell's core **intent** or delivery method (e.g., a projectile, a self-buff, an area-of-effect), while subsequent Elements act as **modifiers**, adding properties or altering the effect.

This system allows for immense creativity and tactical flexibility, reflecting the personal and experimental nature of pagan magic.

### Pure Element Spells

When an element is used on its own, without any modifiers, it produces its most fundamental effect. These are the simplest spells to forge, but they form the building blocks of all magic.

| Element | Pure Spell | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Life` | **Mend** | A small burst of healing energy that restores a minor amount of the caster's health. |
| `Death` | **Wither** | A touch that causes a target's armor and weapons to temporarily decay, reducing their effectiveness. |
| `Spirit` | **Spirit Ward** | A brief defensive aura that reduces incoming damage from magical or ethereal sources. |
| `Time` | **Hasten** | A self-cast buff that slightly increases the caster's movement and attack speed for a few seconds. |
| `Chaos` | **Unpredictable Bolt** | A projectile that has a random effect on impact, such as a small explosion, a flash of light, or a minor curse. |
| `Mind` | **Focus** | A self-cast buff that briefly reduces the Willpower cost of the next spell forged. |
| `Fire` | **Spark** | A small, fast projectile of fire that deals minor damage. |
| `Water` | **Cleanse** | A splash of water that removes one negative status effect from the caster or an ally. |
| `Earth` | **Tremor** | A small shockwave at the caster's feet that briefly staggers nearby enemies. |
| `Air` | **Gust** | A blast of wind that pushes back a single enemy. |
| `Metal` | **Reinforce** | A self-cast buff that temporarily increases the caster's armor rating. |
| `Blood` | **Bloodletting** | A targeted spell that causes a minor bleed effect, dealing damage over time. |
| `Beast` | **Primal Roar** | A shout that has a chance to cause weak enemies to hesitate for a moment. |
| `Deception` | **Distract** | Creates a sound or visual illusion at a target location to draw enemy attention. |
| `Fear` | **Intimidate** | A targeted debuff that slightly reduces an enemy's attack damage for a short time. |
| `Freedom` | **Unfetter** | Instantly removes any slowing or immobilizing effects from the caster. |

### Spellforging Examples: The Power of Combination

Combining elements is the true heart of magic in Reval. While a single element produces a simple effect, combining two creates a spell of significantly greater power and utility.

#### Two-Element Spells

Here are some examples of what can be achieved by forging two elements together.

| Sequence | Forged Spell | Effect |

| `Freedom` + `Sacrifice` | **Liberating Burst** | Sacrifice a portion of your health to break all bonds and knock back all nearby enemies. |
| `Earth` + `Fear` | **Quaking Dread** | A tremor that not only staggers enemies but also reduces their attack damage for a short time. |
| `Metal` + `Order` | **Shrapnel Shot** | A projectile that fires a cone of metal shards in a predictable, orderly pattern. |
