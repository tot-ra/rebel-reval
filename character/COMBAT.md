# ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Mechanics

Combat in Reval is a brutal and tactical affair, blending visceral melee, calculated ranged attacks, and the world-shaping power of **[spellforging](MAGIC-ELEMENTS.md)**. A successful warrior must master not only their weapon but also the flow of battle, knowing when to press the attack, when to defend, and when to unleash their inner power.

## üéØ Core Combat Concepts

-   **Stamina Management:** Every action in combat‚Äîattacking, dodging, blocking, and sprinting‚Äîconsumes stamina. Managing your stamina is crucial. Exhausting it will leave you winded and vulnerable to a devastating counter-attack.
-   **Attack & Defense:** Combat revolves around a system of light attacks, heavy attacks, blocks, and dodges.
    -   **Light Attacks:** Fast but do less damage. Good for interrupting weaker foes.
    -   **Heavy Attacks:** Slow but powerful. Can break an enemy's guard but leave you open if you miss.
    -   **Blocking:** Using a weapon or shield to absorb incoming damage. Reduces stamina. A perfectly timed block can create a parry opportunity.
    -   **Dodging:** A quick maneuver to evade an attack entirely. Consumes a significant amount of stamina.
-   **Poise & Stagger:** Both the player and enemies have a hidden "poise" meter. Heavier armor increases poise. Taking hits drains poise. Once poise is depleted, the character is staggered, interrupting their action and leaving them open to a critical hit.
