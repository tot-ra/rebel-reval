### Prequel Chapter: The Forging of Chains

**TITLE CARD: "REVAL, 1342 - ACT 1: THE SIMMERING CITY"**

**KALEV** stands at his forge, hammer suspended mid-strike. Through the window, he watches a Danish tax collector extract silver from Old Henrik's trembling hands - the man's last coins, meant for his daughter's wedding dowry.

The hammer falls. The heated iron splits.

**KALEV**
(Muttering an old Estonian curse)
Kurat võtku...

His apprentice **MART** (16) looks up nervously.

**MART**
Master Kalev? The blade—

**KALEV**
(Staring at the ruined metal)
Some things are meant to break, boy. Question is whether we forge them again... or melt them down for something sharper.

**(He looks back out the window as Henrik weeps)**

**KALEV (CONT'D)**
Fetch more iron. And bank the fires hotter tonight.

### Act 1: The Simmering City (year 1342)
- Gameplay Focus: Political intrigue, stealth, and character development. This phase is about building your power and choosing your allies.
- Player Goal: Navigate the treacherous social landscape of Reval. Your actions will build your reputation with different factions, unlocking unique abilities and story paths. Every choice you make determines who will stand with you—and who will stand against you—when the city finally erupts.
- Narrative Arc: This phase is a slow-burn thriller. You'll uncover conspiracies, perform secret missions for different factions, and make difficult choices that have no clear right answer. The "Living City" meters (Hope, Fear, Chaos) are your primary measure of progress.

- **Chapter Conclusion:** The chapter concludes on the eve of St. George's Night, April 23, 1343. The player's actions throughout the chapter accumulate towards this date, influencing the city's state via the **Hope, Fear, and Chaos** meters. The final quests of this chapter will represent the tipping point, and the state of the meters at the end of the day will determine the opening scenario of Chapter 2, defining the strength and nature of the rebellion. The player may also catch whispers of a third power, a group of merchants and knights playing both sides for their own gain, known only by their strange reptilian sigil.





### Act 2: The Fire of Rebellion (year 1343)
- Gameplay Focus: Character progression, new challenges. Open warfare, tactical combat, and large-scale battles. This phase begins on St. George's Night, April 23, 1343.
- Player Goal: Survive and lead your chosen faction to victory. For the rebels, this means fighting for independence and driving out the foreign lords. For the rulers, this means crushing the uprising, restoring order, and punishing the seditious. Your missions will be based on the real-life timeline of the rebellion, allowing you to either follow history or rewrite it:
- The Siege of Reval: Help the Estonian rebels in their attempt to take the city, or side with the Livonian Order to break the siege.
- The Battle of Pärnu: Engage in a major field battle against the knights, either as a rebel warrior or an Order champion.
- The Swedish/Pskov Gambit: As a rebel, attempt to secure aid from neighbours. As a ruler, sabotage the rebels' efforts and ensure no foreign aid arrives.
- Narrative Arc: This phase is a desperate, action-packed struggle for the future of Estonia. The choices you made in Phase 1 will have dramatic consequences, determining which missions are available to you and what resources you have at your disposal.

### Act 3: The Iron Harvest (1344-1345)

*Six months after the siege of Reval. Snow covers the bloodstains, but the scars remain.*

**OPENING SCENE:**
**FADE IN:** Kalev's forge, now cold and abandoned. Frost covers his tools. Through the window, we see Reval's walls pocked with siege damage, hastily repaired with mismatched stone.

A KNOCK at the door. Kalev opens it to find **BROTHER HERMANN**, a Teutonic Knight, flanked by two soldiers.

**BROTHER HERMANN**
(In broken Estonian, then switching to Latin-accented German)
Kalev the Smith. The Order has... acquired your services.

**KALEV**
(Noting the chains the soldiers carry)
Acquired. Is that what we're calling it?

**BROTHER HERMANN**
The Grandmaster is rebuilding Estonia in God's image. Your skills will serve a higher purpose now.
(Gestures to the cold forge)
Light your fires. You forge for Christ now.

**KALEV**
(Looking at his grandfather's tools, then at the chains)
And if I refuse?

**BROTHER HERMANN**
(Smiling coldly)
Then you join the heretics feeding the crows on Toompea hill.

Unlike Acts 1 and 2, where Kalev could hide behind "just following orders" or "just surviving," Act 3 forces him to confront what he's become. Every weapon he forges now directly serves his oppressors.

**INTERNAL MONOLOGUE DURING FORGING SCENE:**
**KALEV (V.O.)**
(As he hammers out a sword blade)
Each strike of the hammer... each spark that flies... I tell myself it's just metal. Just work.
(The blade begins to take shape - clearly a Teutonic design)
But this blade will drink Estonian blood. These hands that once forged freedom now forge chains.
(He pauses, hammer raised)
Lembitu... forgive me.

**THE SAAREMAA CAMPAIGN:**
**SCENE:** The siege of Pöide Castle, Saaremaa

Kalev watches Estonian defenders on the walls - men who look like his father, his brother, himself. Below, Teutonic siege engines (built with metal he forged) prepare to fire.

**KALEV**
(To Brother Hermann)
Those are my people on those walls.

**BROTHER HERMANN**
They are heretics and oath-breakers. Your people are the baptized Christians of this land.

**KALEV**
(Watching a young Estonian archer - no older than his apprentice Mart)
That boy... he could be my son.

**BROTHER HERMANN**
Then pray he sees reason before the walls fall.

The siege engine releases. Stone and metal crash against the wall. The young archer disappears in dust and debris.

**KALEV**
(Something breaking inside him)
I forged the iron that killed him.

**BROTHER HERMANN**
You forged the instruments of God's will.

**CLIMACTIC CHOICE:**
**SCENE:** The final battle approaches. Hermann presents Kalev with a choice:

**BROTHER HERMANN**
The Grandmaster offers you a choice, smith. Forge the blessed sword that will end this rebellion - strike down the last pagan king yourself - and earn full redemption. Your family name restored, land granted, a place among the faithful.

**KALEV**
And if I refuse?

**BROTHER HERMANN**
Then tomorrow, when we take the grove, your wife and daughter burn with the sacred trees.

**(Through the tent flap, Kalev can see his family, held under guard)**

**KALEV**
(His voice breaking)
You would make me choose between my soul and their lives?

**BROTHER HERMANN**
I offer you salvation. The choice was always yours.

**TRANSITION TO EPILOGUE:**
**CLOSE-UP:** Kalev's hands, now stained with more than forge-soot.

**KALEV (V.O.)**
I told myself I was just making horseshoes. Just repairing farm tools. Just... surviving.

**(Camera pulls back to reveal the consequences of his choice)**

**KALEV (V.O.)**
But a blade doesn't care who swings it. And a choice doesn't care if you meant to make it.

### Epilogue: The Last Song (1351)

*Eight years have passed. The rebellion is a memory. The old gods are silent.*

**OPENING - ESTABLISH THE WORLD:**
**FADE IN:** Reval, 1351. The city looks prosperous - new stone buildings, fresh paint, busy markets. But something feels hollow, like a beautiful mask over a skull.

**CLOSE-UP:** A small wooden carving of Taara, hastily shoved under loose floorboards as **FOOTSTEPS** approach. A child's hands - these belong to **LIISA** (8), granddaughter of the old Volkhv from the prequel.

**LIISA'S GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)**
(Whispered, urgent)
Hide it deeper, child. The priests have sharp eyes.

**LIISA**
Grandmother, why must we hide the forest father?

**GRANDMOTHER**
(Kneeling, touching the child's face)
Because, little star, they fear what they cannot chain. Now come - we must seem good Christians when the bells ring.

**THE PLAGUE ARRIVES - BUT WITH PURPOSE:**
**SCENE:** Liisa finds an ornate wooden box washed up from a trading ship. Inside: beautiful amber beads, a trader's goods from the east. But also... something else.

**LIISA**
(Touching the amber)
It feels warm, like summer stones.

As she lifts the beads, we see her fingers briefly glow with the same light we saw around the sacred oak in the prequel. The old magic, weakened but not dead.

**THE BITTER IRONY:**
**GRANDMOTHER (V.O.)**
(As Liisa plays with the beads)
The Christians said their god would protect the faithful. They burned our sacred groves to build their churches. They buried our songs beneath their hymns.

**(Liisa laughs, sharing the beads with other children)**

**GRANDMOTHER (V.O.)**
But death... death remembers the old ways. Death doesn't care which god you pray to.

**THE BLESSING GAME:**
Instead of random tag, Liisa teaches the other children an old Estonian game - one that involves touching foreheads and sharing "forest blessings." Each child she touches glows briefly with that same amber light.

**LIISA**
(Laughing as she runs)
Taara's blessing! Taara's blessing! You're blessed now!

The other children giggle and run, not understanding they're performing an ancient ritual. The irony: in trying to destroy Estonian culture, the Christians have made the children hungry for any game, any song, any story that feels different.

**THE FINAL REVELATION:**
As the plague spreads, we realize: this isn't random supernatural punishment. The amber beads were from a plague ship. But Liisa's "blessing game" - the old ritual of touching foreheads - spread it faster than it should have spread naturally.

**KALEV (V.O.)**
(Now an old man, watching from his window as the death carts roll)
I spent my life forging chains for my people. But the old gods... they forge justice from different metal.

**(He looks at his weathered hands - the same hands that once touched the sacred oak)**

**KALEV (V.O.)**
Death is the last freedom they cannot conquer. And death, it seems, remembers whose side it was always on.

**FINAL SHOT:** The abandoned churches as the priests flee the plague. In the empty silence, we hear - faintly - the sound of Liisa and the other ghost children, still playing their game, their laughter echoing like wind through dead leaves.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**TEXT:** "In 1351, the Black Death reached the Baltic. Among its first victims were the clergymen and nobles who had conquered Estonia. The plague, it was said, showed no favor to Christian or pagan. But the children's songs... those survived."
