A small, squalid hovel tucked away in a foul-smelling alley, home to the city's official vermin controller.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a dilapidated, single-room hovel in a narrow, muddy alley of medieval Reval, circa 1343. The building is a crude construction of mismatched timber and wattle and daub, with a sagging thatched roof. The single wooden door hangs crookedly on its hinges, and there are no windows. Several small, crudely made wooden traps are stacked against the outside wall, and a pungent, unpleasant odor hangs in the air.

## What it's for

The Rat Catcher's Hovel is the home of one of the city's most unpleasant but necessary residents. The rat catcher is responsible for controlling the vermin population, a constant threat to the city's health and food supplies. It is a grim and thankless job, and the hovel reflects the low social standing of its occupant.
