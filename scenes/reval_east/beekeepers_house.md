A small, quiet house with a surprisingly lush garden, buzzing with the gentle sound of honeybees.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a quaint, single-story house in a secluded corner of medieval Reval's eastern quarter, circa 1343. The house is timber-framed with whitewashed wattle-and-daub walls and a dark, thatched roof. What sets it apart is the vibrant garden surrounding it, filled with flowering plants and herbs. Several woven, dome-shaped beehives (skeps) are arranged neatly in the sunniest part of the garden. A simple wooden fence separates the property from the surrounding alleyways.

## What it's for

The Beekeeper's House is the home of a man who practices the ancient art of apiculture within the city walls. It is a place of calm and nature amidst the urban environment. The beekeeper harvests honey, a valuable sweetener and medicinal ingredient, and beeswax, which is prized by chandlers for making high-quality candles.
