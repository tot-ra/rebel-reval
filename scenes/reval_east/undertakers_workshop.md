A quiet, somber workshop where the city's dead are prepared for their final journey.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a respectable, two-story building in a quiet street of medieval Reval's eastern quarter, circa 1343. The ground floor is made of dark, sober-looking stone, while the upper story is timber-framed. The roof is tiled with grey slate. The windows on the ground floor are covered with heavy shutters, and a discreet, unadorned wooden sign in the shape of a simple coffin hangs above the door. The workshop is clean and well-maintained, but has an air of perpetual solemnity.

## What it's for

The Undertaker's Workshop is a place of quiet reverence and necessary service. Here, the deceased are respectfully prepared for burial, washed, and dressed in their final garments. The undertaker also constructs simple pine coffins for the common folk and more ornate ones for those who can afford them. It is a place most people try to avoid, but one that everyone will eventually need.
