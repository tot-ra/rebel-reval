### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a fletcher's shop in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The shop is a narrow, two-story building, with a timber-framed upper story and a limestone ground floor. The roof is covered in wooden shingles. A wooden sign with a crossed arrow and bow is hanging above the door. The shop window displays a selection of arrows, with different types of heads and fletchings.

## What it's for

The Fletcher's Shop is a vital supplier to the city's defenses and hunters. Here, skilled hands craft the arrows that arm the city guard and supply those who venture into the forests for game. The shop is a quiet, focused place, filled with the scent of wood shavings and goose feathers, and the soft sounds of knives shaping arrow shafts and feathers being trimmed.
