### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a glover's workshop in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The workshop is a small, single-story building, with a timber-framed structure and a thatched roof. A wooden sign with a painted glove hangs above the door. The shop has a small, leaded glass window, and a variety of leather gloves are displayed on a rack outside.

## What it's for

The Glover's Workshop is a place of delicate and precise work. Here, soft, supple leather is transformed into the fine gloves worn by the city's wealthy merchants and nobility. From elegant ladies' gloves to the sturdy gauntlets of knights, the glover's craft is a symbol of status and refinement.
