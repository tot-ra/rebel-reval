A yard where bricks are made for the city's construction projects.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a brick maker's yard in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The yard is a large, muddy area, dominated by a large, wood-fired kiln. Stacks of unfired, grey bricks are arranged in neat rows, drying in the sun. Piles of fired, red bricks are ready for transport. A simple, wooden shed provides shelter for the brick maker's tools.

## What it's for

The Brick Maker's Yard is a foundational industry for the ever-growing city of Reval. Here, clay and earth are transformed by fire into the sturdy red bricks that form the walls of houses, guildhalls, and fortifications. It is a place of hard, manual labor, where the air is thick with the smoke from the kiln and the smell of damp earth.
