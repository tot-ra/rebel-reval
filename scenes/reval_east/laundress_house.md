A humble dwelling where the endless, steamy work of washing the quarter's linens takes place.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a small, single-story timber-framed house in the eastern quarter of medieval Reval, circa 1343. The house has a steeply pitched thatched roof and wattle-and-daub walls. A simple wooden door and two small, unglazed windows face the street. Outside, a large wooden washtub sits next to the door, and lines of laundry are strung up between the house and a nearby tree, billowing in the breeze. Steam occasionally wafts from the open doorway.

## What it's for

The Laundress's House is the workplace and home of a woman who washes the clothes and linens for many of the quarter's residents. It is a place of constant, hard labor, filled with the smell of lye soap, damp cloth, and hot water. The laundress provides an essential service, keeping the community clean and presentable.
