### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a cooper's workshop in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The workshop is a sturdy, timber-framed building with a shingled roof. The front of the workshop is open to the street, revealing a cluttered interior filled with barrels, staves, and hoops. A large, iron fire pit is used for heating and shaping the barrel staves.

## What it's for

The Cooper's Workshop is crucial to Reval's trade and daily life. Barrels are the shipping containers of the 14th century, and the coopers of this workshop produce the sturdy casks needed to transport everything from salted fish and grain to beer and wine. The workshop is a noisy, active place, filled with the rhythmic sound of hammers on wood and the scent of heated pitch used to seal the barrels.
