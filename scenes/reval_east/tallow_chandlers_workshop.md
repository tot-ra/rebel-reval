### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a tallow chandler's workshop in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The workshop is a small, single-story building with stone walls and a thatched roof. A large, iron cauldron for rendering animal fat sits over a fire pit outside the workshop. The air around the workshop is thick with the smell of burning fat.

## What it's for

The Tallow Chandler's Workshop provides an essential commodity for the city's residents: light. In an age before electricity, the tallow candles produced here are a necessity for navigating the dark streets and illuminating homes and businesses after sunset. Though not as clean-burning or fragrant as the beeswax candles favored by the wealthy, tallow candles are affordable for the common folk, making this workshop a cornerstone of daily life in the quarter.
