A workshop where the city's weavers produce roughspun cloth. The rhythmic clatter of looms is a constant sound.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a modest, two-story timber-framed building in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The ground floor is constructed from rough-hewn limestone, showing signs of age with moss creeping between the stones. The upper story is timber-framed with wattle and daub infill, which is weathered and cracked. A steep, gabled roof is covered in dark wooden shingles, with a small dormer window peeking out. The main entrance is a simple, sturdy wooden door. A narrow, unglazed window on the ground floor is covered by wooden shutters. The building is situated on a cobblestone street, and there are a few stray chickens pecking at the ground nearby.

## What it's for

The Weavers' Collective is the heart of textile production in the eastern quarter. Here, the rhythmic clatter of looms fills the air as weavers, mostly women, transform raw wool and flax into the roughspun cloth that clothes the city's common folk. It's a place of constant, repetitive labor, but also of community and shared stories among the workers.
