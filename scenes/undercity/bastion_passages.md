# The Bastion Passages

Beneath the cobblestone streets of Reval lies a hidden world of tunnels and passages, known collectively as the Undercity. The most significant of these are the Bastion Passages, a network of defensive tunnels that have become a refuge for the city's outcasts and a breeding ground for its darkest legends.

## Description

The Bastion Passages are a labyrinth of damp, narrow corridors, dimly lit by flickering torches and the faint glow of phosphorescent moss. The air is thick with the smell of wet earth and decay, and the silence is broken only by the dripping of water and the distant echoes of the city above.

The passages are a dangerous place, home to smugglers, thieves, and desperate souls seeking shelter from the harsh realities of 14th-century Reval. They are also rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of soldiers who died defending the city, and by even darker things that have been drawn to the city's underbelly.

## Key Locations

- **The Sunken Market:** A hidden market where smugglers and thieves ply their trade, offering rare and forbidden goods to those who know where to look.
- **The Pauper's Camp:** A makeshift settlement where the city's homeless and destitute have found a semblance of community.
- **The Devil's Cellar:** A walled-off section of the passages, rumored to be the site of a demonic ritual. The air here is unnaturally cold, and strange symbols are carved into the stone walls. It is said that anyone who lingers too long in this area will be driven mad by whispers from the darkness.

## Inhabitants

- **The Tunnel Rats:** A loose affiliation of smugglers and thieves who use the passages to move goods and people in and out of the city undetected.
- **The Forgotten:** The city's outcasts, who have made a home in the darkness beneath the city. They are wary of outsiders, but may offer aid to those who earn their trust.
- **The Watchers:** Mysterious figures who are sometimes seen lurking in the shadows of the passages. It is unclear who they are or what they want, but they are a source of fear and superstition among the other inhabitants of the Undercity.

## Quests and Opportunities

The Bastion Passages offer a wealth of opportunities for a resourceful player.

- **Smuggling Runs:** The Tunnel Rats are always in need of people to help them move goods, offering handsome rewards for those willing to risk the dangers of the passages.
- **The Lost Heirloom:** A desperate noble asks you to retrieve a family heirloom that was stolen by a thief who has taken refuge in the Undercity.
- **The Devil's Due:** A terrified priest begs you to investigate the strange happenings in the Devil's Cellar and put an end to the evil that lurks there.
