# Sailmakers' Workshop

A large, open workshop, with a floor of polished wood and a high, vaulted ceiling. Bolts of canvas are stacked against the walls, and the air is filled with the clean, sharp scent of waxed linen.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a sailmakers' workshop in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The workshop is a large, timber-framed building with a high, vaulted ceiling. Sunlight streams in through a series of large, arched windows, illuminating the vast, open space. The floor is made of wide, polished planks, and is covered with bolts of canvas and the tools of the sailmaking trade.

## What it's for

The Sailmakers' Workshop is where the sails that power Reval's merchant fleet are made. It is a place of precision and skill, where master craftsmen transform humble canvas into the wings that carry ships across the sea.
