# Shipwrights' Yard

A bustling hub of activity, where the skeletons of new ships rise from the ground and the air is filled with the scent of sawdust and tar.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a bustling shipwrights' yard in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The yard is located on the waterfront, and several ships are in various stages of construction. The ground is littered with wood shavings, and the air is filled with the sound of hammers and saws. A large, open-sided shed dominates the yard, and several smaller workshops are scattered around it.

## What it's for

The Shipwrights' Yard is where the ships that are the lifeblood of Reval's trade are built and repaired. It is a place of hard work and skilled craftsmanship, where the raw materials of the forest are transformed into the vessels that sail the Baltic Sea.
