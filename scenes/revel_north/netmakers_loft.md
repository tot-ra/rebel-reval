# Netmakers' Loft

A large, airy loft, filled with the smell of tar and the sea. Nets of all shapes and sizes hang from the rafters, and the floor is littered with the tools of the trade.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a netmakers' loft in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The loft is located in the upper story of a timber-framed building near the harbor. The room is large and open, with exposed beams and a high ceiling. Sunlight streams in through a large, unglazed window, illuminating the dust motes that dance in the air. Nets are draped over the rafters, and piles of rope and twine are scattered across the floor.

## What it's for

The Netmakers' Loft is where the fishing nets that are essential to Reval's fishing industry are made and repaired. It is a place of patient, meticulous work, where skilled hands transform simple twine into the complex webs that bring in the bounty of the sea.
