# The Rebel Kings' Camp

**Game Scene:** `rebel_kings.tscn`

A large, mobile encampment that serves as the military headquarters for the Harju Kings and the main rebel army. This is where the player can receive quests, interact with rebel leaders, and participate in the strategic planning of the uprising.

## Factions Present

### The Harju Kings ‚úäüèª
This is the command center for the rural rebellion.
-   **Core NPCs:** **Lembit Helme**, **Kaja Lahekivi**, **J√ºri Ratnik**, and **Urmas Laar** can all be found here, leading their forces.

### Music
- **Hopeful, Determined, United:** A powerful, anthemic theme with a strong choral presence, folk instruments (flute, fiddle, bagpipes), and a driving, march-like rhythm.
- **Militaristic, Rustic, DIY:** The sounds of a camp preparing for war‚Äîsharpening blades, fletching arrows, mending armor‚Äîset to a percussive, rhythmic backdrop.
- **Somber, Reflective, Wary:** A lone voice singing a lament, a simple melody on a wooden flute, the crackling of a campfire, the distant howl of a wolf.
- **Mystical, Ancient, Pagan:** Throat singing, shamanic drumming, the use of traditional Estonian instruments like the kannel, music that feels connected to the land and the old gods.
- **Tense, Anxious, Expectant:** A low, pulsing drone; the rhythmic beat of a single drum; short, repeated melodic fragments that create a sense of anticipation and unease.
