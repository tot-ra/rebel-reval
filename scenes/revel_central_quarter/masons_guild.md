# Masons' Guild

A sturdy, practical building, constructed from the very stone that is the lifeblood of the guild. The air is thick with the dust of the quarry, and the sound of hammers and chisels is a constant, rhythmic beat.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a masons' guild hall in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The guildhall is a single-story, stone building with a slate roof. The walls are thick and solid, with small, unglazed windows. A large, open yard in front of the guildhall is littered with blocks of stone in various stages of being worked.

## What it's for

The Masons' Guild is where the stone for Reval's grand buildings is cut and shaped. It is a place of hard labor and patient craftsmanship, where the raw, unyielding stone is transformed into the graceful arches and soaring spires that define the city's skyline.
