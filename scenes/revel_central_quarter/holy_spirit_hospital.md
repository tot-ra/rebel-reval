# Church of the Holy Spirit Hospital

The Church of the Holy Spirit in Tallinn has a complex construction history that spans several centuries, with its origins closely tied to a medieval hospital or almshouse complex.

## Original Hospital Complex

The church was originally part of a larger almshouse complex established in the late 13th century. This almshouse functioned as a medieval hospital, providing care and shelter for the poor and sick, which was a common practice for religious institutions during that period.

## Church Construction Timeline

The actual church building has multiple construction phases:

**Initial Foundation**: The church was founded before 1319, with building work probably starting sometime during the first half of the 14th century.

**Completion**: The main structure was completed by 1380, making it one of the oldest religious buildings in Tallinn's Old Town.

## Architectural Evolution

The church underwent numerous additions and transformations until the mid-17th century. Key developments included:

- The main altar has remained unchanged since 1483 and was created by Berndt Notke in the 15th century
- Wooden galleries and a wooden pulpit were added in the 17th century, both adorned with painted biblical scenes
- The renaissance spire and clock also date back to the 17th century
- The current spire is a reconstruction from 2002 after a fire

## Historical Significance

In medieval times, this served as the main sanctuary for commoners and later became significant for Estonian culture when it hosted the first Estonian sermons instead of German ones after the Reformation. The church is located in Tallinn's Old Town at PÃ¼havaimu 2 and remains an active Lutheran parish church today.
