# St. Michael's Cistercian Nunnery (Mihkli klooster)

The construction date of St. Michael's Cistercian Nunnery in Tallinn cannot be pinpointed to a single year, but archaeological evidence and historical records provide important insights into its medieval origins and development.

## Archaeological Evidence from the Abbess's Residence

The most precise dating comes from building archaeological investigations conducted on the abbess's residence within the St. Michael's convent complex. Dendrochronological analysis of wooden beams revealed that the trees used in construction were felled in 1448, with the actual construction of the abbess's residence likely beginning in 1449. This analysis examined 29 wood samples from various parts of the building, including beams from the southern and northern basement areas and the entresol.

## Medieval Context and Earlier Origins

While the abbess's residence dates to the mid-15th century, the nunnery itself was likely established earlier during the medieval period. By 1631, historical records refer to it as the "old St. Michael's monastery," indicating it had been in existence for a considerable time before that date. The complex was part of the broader medieval monastic landscape in Tallinn, serving as a Cistercian convent for nuns.

## Architectural Characteristics

The investigated buildings within the complex show sophisticated medieval construction techniques, including hypocaust heating systems typical of medieval Tallinn. The abbess's residence represented a small urban house with established spatial organization, featuring dedicated areas for heating systems and storage in the basement level, with residential and office spaces on the main floor.

## Later Historical Development

The monastery complex eventually became part of the Swedish parish infrastructure when Gustav Adolf II decided in 1631 that the monastery church should be granted to the Swedish parish and that the first elementary and secondary school should be established in the old St. Michael's monastery buildings. Today, the site is known to many as one of the oldest continuously used religious complexes in Tallinn.
