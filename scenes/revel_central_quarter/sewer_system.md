# Sewer System

The available historical records do not provide specific details about sewer systems in 14th century Tallinn. However, the broader context of medieval urban sanitation reveals important insights about waste management during this period.

## Medieval Urban Sanitation Context

Most cities prior to the Industrial Revolution did not have functioning sewer systems, instead relying on nearby rivers or rain to wash away sewage from the streets. This was a significant limiting factor for urban population growth, as waste and sanitation issues posed major challenges for medieval settlements. The Roman Empire's elaborate water supply and sewerage systems were exceptional for their time and enabled much larger urban populations than was typical in the medieval period.

## Tallinn's 14th Century Urban Development

During the 14th century, Tallinn had developed into one of the most important intermediate ports of the Hanseatic trade road between Europe and Russia. The city experienced significant growth and construction activity, with its defensive walls featuring 24 defensive towers and structures by the final quarter of the century. The upper town (Toompea) served as the administrative center, while the lower town maintained its medieval urban fabric of narrow winding streets.

## Political and Administrative Changes

A major transition occurred in 1346-1347 when Tallinn changed from Danish to German Order control. The city maintained its governance through a Town Council elected from the most influential and wealthy residents, primarily merchants, who managed municipal affairs including basic infrastructure needs.

Given the general patterns of medieval urban development and the lack of specific documentation about advanced sanitation systems in the historical records, it appears that 14th century Tallinn likely followed typical medieval practices for waste management rather than having sophisticated sewer infrastructure. The city's position as a Baltic trading port would have provided natural drainage toward the sea, which was commonly utilized by medieval coastal cities for waste disposal.
