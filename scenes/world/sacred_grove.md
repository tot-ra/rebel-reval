### Music
- **Mystical, Magical, Otherworldly:** Ethereal choirs, shimmering synths, and traditional instruments like the kannel and flute create a sense of a world apart, a place of ancient magic and deep spiritual power.
- **Primal, Ritualistic, Dangerous:** Heavy, rhythmic drumming, guttural chanting, and the sounds of nature‚Äîwind, animal calls, rustling leaves‚Äîbuild to a frenzied, ecstatic climax.
- **Serene, Tranquil, Meditative:** The gentle sounds of a flowing stream, birdsong, and a simple, melodic theme for a solo instrument like a harp or a flute create a sense of peace and harmony with nature.
- **Dark, Corrupted, Sacrificial:** A dissonant, unsettling score with a heavy emphasis on low strings and percussion, a sense of a dark and ancient evil, and the sounds of a blood sacrifice.
- **Ancient, Wise, All-Knowing:** A slow, majestic theme with a sense of deep history and wisdom, featuring a lone, ancient-sounding voice and the use of traditional instruments in a sparse, minimalist arrangement.
