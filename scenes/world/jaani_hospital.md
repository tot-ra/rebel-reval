# Jaani Hospital (Leprosorium)

The Jaani Hospital (St. John's Hospital) in Tallinn has its origins dating back to the beginning of the 13th century, making it one of the oldest healthcare-related structures in Estonia's capital.

## Historical Development and Timeline

The original construction was a stone church that served as "John's hospital" (Estonian: Jaani hospidal). This medieval institution represented an early form of healthcare facility that combined religious and medical functions, which was typical for the period.

Over the centuries, the facility underwent several transformations and name changes. The building was later renamed to John's almshouse church (Estonian: Jaani seegi kirik), reflecting its evolving role in serving the community's needs. During its operational period, the building also functioned as a leprosarium, providing care for patients with leprosy, which was a common healthcare challenge in medieval Europe.

## 19th Century Transition

A significant milestone occurred in 1813 when the hospital was officially renamed to "almshouse" (Estonian: vaestemaja), marking its transition from a medical facility to an institution focused on providing shelter and care for the poor and elderly.

## Modern Status

Today, the original Jaani Hospital building has been repurposed as a wooden church and has been designated as an "architectural monument" since 1999. The structure is currently used by a congregation belonging to the Armenian Apostolic Church, representing a complete transformation from its medieval healthcare origins.

This historical healthcare facility represents nearly eight centuries of continuous use and adaptation, illustrating the evolution of medical care and social services in Tallinn from medieval times to the present day.
