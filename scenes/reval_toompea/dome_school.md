# Dome School (Toompea Kool)

The Dome School in Tallinn was established in the 13th century at the cathedral. This makes it the oldest secondary school in Tallinn that continues to operate today.

## Historical Context

The Dome School was founded in connection with Tallinn's cathedral (Toomkirik), reflecting the medieval tradition of cathedral schools that served as important centers of learning throughout Europe. The establishment of the school in the 13th century places its founding during the period when Tallinn was developing as a significant medieval trading city.

## Significance

What makes the Dome School particularly notable is its continuous operation for over 700 years, maintaining its educational mission from medieval times to the present day. This longevity makes it not only the oldest secondary school in Tallinn but also one of the longest-running educational institutions in Estonia.

The exact construction date within the 13th century is not specified in the available information, but the school's connection to the cathedral suggests it was likely established as part of the broader ecclesiastical infrastructure that was being developed in Tallinn during this period of medieval urbanization.

1. Brother Albertus of Riga - Master Scholar
Background: A learned German monk in his 50s who came to establish proper Christian education in the frontier. He speaks Latin, German, and broken Estonian, believing education can "civilize" the natives.

Quest: "The Lost Chronicle" - Brother Albertus has discovered fragments of an ancient Estonian epic that predates Christianity. He needs Kalev to retrieve missing pieces from pagan sites around the city, but the quest forces moral choices: preserve native heritage or help the Church suppress it?

2. Lisette von Bremen - Noble Student
Background: The 17-year-old daughter of a wealthy Hanseatic merchant, one of the few female students allowed at the school. Intelligent and rebellious, she secretly sympathizes with Estonian culture after befriending local servants. Her father wants her educated to make a strategic marriage.

Quest: "Letters in the Dark" - Lisette asks Kalev to secretly deliver love letters to an Estonian blacksmith's apprentice, risking scandal. The quest explores themes of forbidden love across class and cultural lines, with potential consequences for both the rebellion's secrecy and upper-class politics.

3. Magnus Kert - Estonian Serf Student
Background: A 19-year-old Estonian peasant boy, one of the rare locals admitted to the school due to exceptional intelligence. Torn between gratitude for his education and loyalty to his oppressed people. The Church hopes to make him a priest to help control the Estonian population.

Visual Description: Lean build with calloused hands showing his humble origins. Wears simple brown tunic and crude leather boots, contrasting with other students' finery. Has dark, intelligent eyes and prematurely serious expression. Often seen with worn prayer books and crude writing tablets.

Quest: "The Shepherd's Choice" - Magnus discovers plans for a particularly harsh tax collection in his home village. He must choose between warning his family (risking his position) or staying silent. Kalev can influence his decision, affecting the school's perception of Estonian "assimilation."

4. Father Cornelius the Copyist - Elderly Scribe
Background: An aging German priest in his 60s who runs the school's scriptorium. Once idealistic about spreading God's word, now quietly horrified by the Order's brutality. He's been secretly copying Estonian folk songs and prayers, claiming they're "for translation purposes."

Visual Description: Stooped shoulders from decades of hunching over manuscripts. Wispy white hair and a gentle, lined face with kind blue eyes. Ink stains permanently mark his weathered hands. Wears simple priest's robes and walks with a carved wooden staff.

Quest: "The Heretical Texts" - Father Cornelius needs Kalev to hide a collection of "banned" texts that actually contain Estonian cultural knowledge. The quest involves choosing between destroying cultural heritage or risking discovery by the Inquisition.

Background: A gruff 45-year-old Estonian who maintains the school grounds. Former warrior who lost his farm in early German conquests. Speaks fluent German but pretends not to, gathering intelligence while tending gardens. His nickname comes from his sharp, biting wit in Estonian.

Visual Description: Stocky, weathered build with graying beard and missing left pinky finger. Wears patched work clothes and carries various gardening tools that could double as weapons. Has a perpetual scowl but observant brown eyes that miss nothing.

Quest: "Roots and Weeds" - Erik asks Kalev to help him plant "Estonian heritage herbs" in the school garden, disguised among regular plants. The herbs are actually components for traditional medicines and can support the rebellion, but risk exposing his true loyalties.
