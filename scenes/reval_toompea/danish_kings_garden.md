# Danish King's Garden (Taani kuninga aed)

A historic garden on the slopes of Toompea Hill, where legend says the Danish flag (Dannebrog) fell from the sky in 1219 during the battle of Lyndanisse. The garden is a place of quiet contemplation and historical significance.

## NPCs

### The Three Monks

Three mysterious, life-sized bronze monks stand silent vigil in the garden. They are named Ambrosius, Bartholomeus, and Claudius.

- **Ambrosius, the Waiting Monk:** He stands silently, seemingly waiting for a sign or a specific person. He may offer cryptic clues about the future or the past.
- **Bartholomeus, the Praying Monk:** He is in a constant state of prayer. Interacting with him might grant the player a temporary blessing or a moment of peace.
- **Claudius, the Observing Monk:** He watches over the garden and the city below. He might share observations about the player's actions or the state of Reval.

## Quest Ideas

### Ambrosius, the Waiting Monk

- **"The Unsent Message":** Ambrosius entrusts the player with a centuries-old sealed letter. The recipient's name is unreadable. The player must decipher clues from the letter's seal and parchment to find the rightful heir. The message could reveal a prophecy, a land deed, or a confession of an ancient crime, impacting a modern faction.
- **"The Sundered Vow":** Ambrosius is bound by a vow to protect a specific bloodline, now in danger. The player must find the last member of this bloodline and protect them from assassins sent by a rival faction.

### Bartholomeus, the Praying Monk

- **"The Hallowed Spring":** Bartholomeus's prayers are weakening because a sacred spring has been corrupted. The player must travel to the spring's source (in a pagan forest or the undercity), fight corrupted creatures, and perform a cleansing ritual.
- **"Echoes of Penance":** Bartholomeus is trapped in a prayer loop, seeking forgiveness for a sin he witnessed. He asks the player to right this historical wrong, which could involve investigating a wrongful execution or a stolen inheritance, upsetting the city's power balance.

### Claudius, the Observing Monk

- **"The Traitor's Shadow":** Claudius has observed a traitor in the city's leadership but cannot speak of it. He gives the player cryptic visions or riddles pointing to the traitor's identity. The player must decipher the clues, gather evidence, and decide whether to expose the traitor, use the information for blackmail, or side with them.
- **"The Gaze of the Watcher":** Claudius's gaze is a ward against a supernatural threat. The ward is weakening, and he needs the player to reinforce it by finding and reactivating ancient runes scattered throughout the city, some in dangerous, faction-controlled areas.

## Music Prompts

1.  **"The Garden of Whispers" (Ambient Exploration):** A sparse and atmospheric track. A lone kantele melody drifts over a bed of soft, ethereal pads and the sound of wind rustling through leaves. The mood is melancholic and contemplative, with a hint of ancient magic.
2.  **"The Monks' Vigil" (Encounter Theme):** A slow, solemn piece featuring a deep, resonant male choir chanting in a liturgical style. The melody is carried by a cello, with occasional chimes and bells adding to the sacred, mysterious atmosphere. The track builds slowly, creating a sense of awe and reverence.
3.  **"The Falling Flag" (Story Moment):** A dramatic and emotional track for a cinematic moment. It starts with the tense, rhythmic beat of a single drum, then swells with a full string section and a soaring female vocal. The music should convey a sense of hope, divine intervention, and the turning of the tide.
4.  **"A Memory of Denmark" (Nostalgic Theme):** A gentle and lyrical piece featuring a recorder or flute playing a simple, folk-like melody. A harp provides a delicate accompaniment. The mood is nostalgic and slightly sorrowful, reflecting the garden's connection to a bygone era.
5.  **"Shadows on the Wall" (Tension/Stealth):** A low, tense drone with dissonant string textures and the subtle, rhythmic clicking of a woodblock. The track should create a sense of unease and danger, suitable for sneaking through the garden at night or uncovering a hidden secret.
