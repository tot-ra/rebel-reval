# Town Council's Apothecary (Raeapteek)

The Raeapteek is one of the oldest continuously running pharmacies in Europe, located in Tallinn's Old Town. It has been operating in the same building since at least 1422.

The pharmacy was run by the Burchart family for over 325 years, from 1582 to 1911. During the medieval period, the pharmacy sold various remedies, including some unusual items like burnt bees, stallion hoofs, and human fat. Marzipan was also sold as a cure for a broken heart.

Today, the Raeapteek continues to operate as a pharmacy and also functions as a museum, showcasing its rich history.
