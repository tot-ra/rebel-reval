# Great Coast Gate

The Great Coastal Gate has a complex construction history spanning multiple centuries, with distinct phases of development that reflect the evolving defensive needs of this medieval Baltic port city.

## Original Medieval Construction

The Great Coastal Gate was first mentioned in historical sources in 1359, initially referred to as "Strandporte" and later as "major Strandporte" from 1384 onward. The original gate structure was added during the 14th century as part of Tallinn's medieval fortification system. This initial construction established the gate as one of the primary access points controlling entry to the city from the harbor area.

## Major 16th Century Reconstruction

The most significant construction phase occurred in the early 16th century, when extensive reconstruction and expansion works transformed the Great Coastal Gate into a formidable defensive complex. Construction works began in 1510, fundamentally altering the gate's appearance and defensive capabilities.

During this reconstruction period, the coastal gate received substantial additions, most notably a new barbican and the western artillery tower known as "Fat Margaret" (Paks Margareeta). The Fat Margaret tower was built from 1511 to 1530, designed as a massive artillery fortification with a three-quarter circular shape, 25-meter diameter, and walls ranging from 2.25 to 5.5 meters thick.

The main construction works were completed by 1529, as indicated by a dolomite plaque featuring a coat of arms in the Flamboyant style on the front of the gate. The entire reconstruction project was finished by 1531.

## Construction Leadership and Design

The reconstruction was overseen by skilled craftsmen, with the artillery tower likely designed by Clemens Pale. From the 1520s, master craftsman Gert Koningk from MÃ¼nster led the construction works, bringing expertise from his previous work on Tallinn's St. Olaf's Church.

## Strategic Purpose and Context

The reconstructed Great Coastal Gate complex was primarily established to protect the harbor and create an imposing defensive presence that would deter potential naval attackers. The gate's strategic location at the end of Pikk Street made it a crucial component of Tallinn's maritime defenses, serving both practical defensive purposes and psychological deterrence for arriving vessels.

The substantial wall thickness of up to 5 meters exceeded the average 3-meter thickness of surrounding city walls, emphasizing the gate's critical importance in the city's defensive strategy.
