# Harju Gate

The exact construction date of the Harju Gate has not been established, although mention of it was first made in 1355.

## Historical Context and Purpose

The Harju Gate was one of the main entrances to medieval Tallinn, located on the south side of the city. It was a crucial part of the city's defense system, controlling access from the direction of PÃ¤rnu and Tartu.

## Architectural Features

The gate complex consisted of a main tower and a foregate, which was built between 1448 and 1452. The main tower was a formidable structure, typical of the defensive architecture of the time.

## Evolution and Preservation

In the middle of the 16th century, the city's south-side fortifications were modernized, and the Harju Gate was closed. It was re-opened in 1767; however, in 1875 its main tower was demolished to make way for modern development.

During the renovation of Freedom Square in 2009, the underground structures of one of the Harju Gate towers were put on display, while the locations of the towers of the gate complex were marked on the pavement, preserving the memory of this once-important structure.
