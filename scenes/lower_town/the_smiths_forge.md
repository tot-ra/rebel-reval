# The Smith's Forge: An Introduction to Kalev

**Game Scene:** `forge.tscn`

**Year:** 1342

**(The scene opens in a dimly lit, smoky forge. The air is thick with the smell of coal, hot metal, and sweat. The rhythmic clang of a hammer on an anvil is the only sound. KALEV, a man in his late 20s, stands before the anvil. He is bare-chested, his body lean but powerful, covered in a sheen of sweat and soot. His face is grim, his eyes focused, his movements precise and economical. He is working on a simple horseshoe, but he gives it the same attention he would a fine sword.)**

**(A young apprentice, JUHAN, about 15, works the bellows, his eyes fixed on Kalev with a mixture of admiration and fear.)**

**JUHAN**
(Timidly)
Master Kalev... the fire... it's hot enough.

**(Kalev doesn't answer. He finishes shaping the horseshoe, his hammer blows ringing with a final, satisfying clarity. He plunges the glowing metal into a trough of water, and the forge is filled with a hiss of steam.)**

**KALEV**
(Wiping his brow with the back of his hand)
It is always hot enough, Juhan. The question is, are you?

**(Before Juhan can answer, the door to the forge creaks open, and a wealthy HANSEATIC MERCHANT, dressed in fine wools and furs, steps inside. He wrinkles his nose at the smell.)**

**MERCHANT**
(In a haughty tone)
Smith! I have an order. I need a new set of hinges for my strongbox. The old ones are... insufficient.

**(Kalev turns slowly, his eyes lingering on the merchant's soft hands and well-fed belly. He says nothing.)**

**MERCHANT**
(Impatiently)
Well? Can you do it? I need them by tomorrow. I will pay you... five shillings.

**(Kalev picks up a heavy hammer, testing its weight in his hand. He looks from the hammer to the merchant, his expression unreadable.)**

**KALEV**
(His voice a low rumble)
The price of iron has gone up. The price of my time has gone up. Ten shillings.

**MERCHANT**
(Scoffing)
Ten shillings! That's robbery! I could get it done for half that in the upper town!

**KALEV**
Then go to the upper town.

**(Kalev turns back to his anvil, dismissing the merchant. The merchant sputters, his face turning red with anger. He is about to say something else, but then he sees the look in Kalev's eyes - a cold, hard glint that reminds him that this is not a man to be trifled with. He throws a small pouch of coins onto a nearby table.)**

**MERCHANT**
Fine! Ten shillings. But they had better be the best damn hinges in all of Reval.

**(The merchant storms out of the forge. Juhan looks at Kalev, his eyes wide.)**

**JUHAN**
Master Kalev... you shouldn't have...

**KALEV**
(Cutting him off)
He can afford it. And we have work to do.

**(Kalev picks up the pouch of coins and hands it to Juhan.)**

**KALEV**
Go. Buy us some bread and cheese. And a bottle of ale. The good stuff.

**(Juhan nods and scurries out of the forge. Kalev is left alone. He looks around his forge, at the tools of his trade, at the sweat and the soot. He picks up a piece of iron and holds it in the fire, his face illuminated by the glowing embers. The camera zooms in on his eyes, and for a moment, we see a flicker of the same fire that burned in his ancestor's eyes a century ago - a fire of defiance, of resentment, of a rebellion waiting to be born.)**

**(The scene fades to black.)**
