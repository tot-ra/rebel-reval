# Knights' Quarters and Barracks

There is no evidence of dedicated knights' quarters or barracks in 14th-century Tallinn. Instead, the city's defense was organized around its extensive system of walls and towers. Knights and soldiers were likely stationed within these defensive towers, with commanders assigned to specific sections of the wall.

## Defensive Infrastructure and Military Organization

Tallinn's military organization in the 14th century was primarily centered around its extensive defensive wall system. By the fourth quarter of the 14th century, Tallinn's city defensive wall already had 24 defensive works in the form of towers and bartizans. The defensive walls themselves were substantial structures, with a total thickness of 2.3-2.6 meters and a height of about 6.5 meters, not including the height of the earth embankment and the slope of land lowering towards the moat.

## Command Structure and Tower Defense

When the expansion of Tallinn's fortifications was completed in 1373, a systematic approach to defense was established with fifteen commanders responsible for the defense of specific towers, with two commanders assigned to each defensive position. This suggests that rather than centralized barracks, the military organization was distributed throughout the defensive system, with commanders likely stationed at or near their assigned towers.
