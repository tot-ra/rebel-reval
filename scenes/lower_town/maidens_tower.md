# Maiden's Tower (Neitsitorn)

The Maiden's Tower in Tallinn was constructed between 1370-1373 during the late 14th century. Originally known as Meghede torne, the tower was erected as part of the defensive wall system built in the Danish King's Garden.

## Historical Context and Purpose

The tower was built as one of the crucial defensive structures protecting medieval Tallinn, serving alongside the famous Kiek in de Kök tower as part of the city's fortification system. It represents one of only 20 surviving towers from Tallinn's Old Town fortification wall, making it a significant remnant of the city's medieval defense architecture.

## Damage and Functional Changes

During the Livonian War (1558-1583), the tower sustained damage that caused it to lose its military functions. After Tallinn lost its status as a fortress city, the tower's defensive role evolved, and by the 19th century, it was converted into residential use. From 1842 to 1960, the tower served as a residence and notably housed Karl Burman, one of Estonia's prominent architects, after World War Two.

## Modern Era and Restoration

The tower underwent significant restoration in the 1970s, with major reconstruction work that rebuilt approximately half of the structure. In 1980, a café was established inside the tower, which became quite popular but eventually closed in the 1990s. Following years of neglect, the tower was recently renovated and reopened to the public as the Maiden's Tower Museum and Café, offering visitors both historical exhibits and panoramic views of Tallinn.

The quadrilateral tower now features a museum with an exhibition hall in its vaulted cellar and maintains its restored café, continuing to serve as both a historical landmark and a cultural destination in Tallinn's Old Town.
