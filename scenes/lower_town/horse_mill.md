# Horse Mill (Hobuveski)

The Tallinn Horse Mill (Tallinna hobuveski) is a 14th-century circular limestone building located in Tallinn's Old Town at Laia street 47. The oldest records of the mill date back to 1379.

The mill was used to grind flour when the city's water mills could not operate, especially during sieges. It played a crucial role during the Livonian War and the Great Northern War.

In 2003, the building was converted into a theater and events venue, and it is now recognized as one of the most extraordinary theaters in Europe.
