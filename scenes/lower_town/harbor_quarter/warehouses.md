# Warehouses

**Location:** Harbor Quarter, Lower Town

Stretching along the cobblestone streets leading from the harbor, these large, sturdy buildings are the heart of Reval's trade. They are filled with goods from all corners of the Hanseatic League and beyond.

## Description

The warehouses are tall, timber-framed buildings with large wooden doors and cranes for hoisting goods to the upper floors. The air is filled with the scent of spices, timber, and canvas. Workers are constantly moving goods, their shouts echoing in the narrow streets.

## Characters

- **Warehouse Foreman:** A busy, no-nonsense man who oversees the loading and unloading of goods.
- **Merchants:** Can be found inspecting their goods or negotiating deals.

## Quests

- **A Rat in the Grain:** A merchant might hire the player to deal with a pest problem of either the four-legged or two-legged variety.
- **Lost Shipment:** The player could be tasked with locating a valuable shipment that has gone missing within the labyrinthine warehouses.

### Music
- **Busy, Rhythmic, Industrial:** The sounds of manual labor—hoisting, hammering, sawing—set to a rhythmic, percussive beat; workers' chants and shouts.
- **Mysterious, Eerie, Suspenseful:** Low, sustained string notes; the scuttling sounds of rats; dripping water; distant, echoing footsteps; a lone, haunting flute.
- **Tense, Stealthy, Dangerous:** A quiet, pulsing rhythm; pizzicato strings; soft, high-pitched percussion; sudden, loud noises that break the silence.
- **Grand, Expansive, Global:** A sweeping, orchestral score with influences from various cultures, representing the diverse origins of the goods stored here.
- **Calm, Quiet, Reflective:** A simple, melodic piece for solo harp or lute; the gentle lapping of water against the docks; the distant cry of gulls.
