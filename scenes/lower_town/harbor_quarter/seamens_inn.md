# Seamen's Inn

**Location:** Harbor Quarter, Lower Town

A dimly lit, rowdy tavern frequented by sailors, dockworkers, and other colorful characters from the harbor. It's a place to gather information, find work, or get into a brawl.

## Description

The inn is a low-ceilinged, smoke-filled room with rough-hewn wooden tables and benches. The air smells of stale ale, sweat, and the sea. A bard in the corner struggles to be heard over the din of drunken sailors singing sea shanties.

## Characters

- **Innkeeper:** A burly woman with a sharp tongue and a keen eye for trouble.
- **Sailors from Foreign Lands:** Can be a source of rumors, quests, or exotic goods.
- **Shady Individuals:** Looking to hire muscle for discreet jobs.

## Quests

- **The Drunken Sailor:** The player might need to extract information from a sailor who has had too much to drink.
- **A Pirate's Treasure:** A mysterious map could lead the player on a treasure hunt.
- **Bar Brawl:** The player might get drawn into a fight, either by accident or on purpose.

### Music
- **Rowdy, Drunken, Lively:** Boisterous sea shanties, out-of-tune lutes, stomping feet, clanking tankards, off-key singing.
- **Mysterious, Rumor-filled, Conspiratorial:** Soft, melodic harp; low, rhythmic drumming; hushed, melodic whispers; a lone, melancholic flute.
- **Tense, Dangerous, Volatile:** A low, rumbling drone; sharp, percussive hits; sudden, dissonant chords; a fast, aggressive fiddle tune.
- **Exotic, Foreign, Adventurous:** Music from distant lands featuring unusual instruments like the oud or sitar, complex rhythms, and non-Western scales.
- **Melancholy, Homesick, Reflective:** A slow, sad ballad sung by a lone female voice; a simple, finger-picked guitar melody; the sound of a gentle accordion.
