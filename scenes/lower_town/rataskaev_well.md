# Rataskaev (The Wheel Well)

A historic well located at the intersection of Rataskaevu and Dunkri streets in Tallinn's Old Town. First mentioned on April 30, 1375, its name comes from the wheel mechanism used to draw water.

### History
The well was used until the mid-19th century when the water quality became too poor. It fell into disuse and was known by the folk name "Kassikaev" (Cat Well) until it was eventually sealed.

### Folklore
