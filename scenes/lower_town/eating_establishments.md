# Eating Establishments, Taverns, and Inns

In the 14th century, Tallinn's eating establishments would have reflected the city's growing importance as a Hanseatic trading center, though specific historical records about individual establishments from this period are limited. However, we can understand the types of dining venues that would have existed based on medieval hospitality practices of the time.

## Types of Medieval Eating Establishments

During the late 14th century, three main types of establishments served food and drink in medieval cities like Tallinn. Alehouses and taverns provided food and drink, while inns offered accommodation for travelers in addition to meals. These establishments were essential to both local community life and the bustling trade that characterized Tallinn during its Hanseatic period.

Taverns served as gathering places where people would drink, exchange news, and could hire a room for the night, while inns were specifically licensed to house lodgers. The distinction was important, as inns catered primarily to merchants and travelers who needed overnight accommodation, while taverns served more as community centers for locals.

## Medieval Hospitality in Tallinn's Context

Given Tallinn's strategic location and membership in the Hanseatic League, the city would have required substantial hospitality infrastructure to serve the constant flow of merchants and travelers. By the 1400s, many larger inns would have private function rooms that could be hired by local town guilds or for private events, and many also provided locked rooms and strong boxes for storage of valuables.

These establishments often operated from private residences where owners took in lodgers, with guests eating at the family dining table or in the kitchens. More elaborate establishments featured 'coffee rooms' for communal dining or private rooms for wealthy lodgers, and some even had small nooks where women could drink in peace, away from the gentlemen.

## Modern Recreations of Medieval Dining

Today's Tallinn preserves this medieval hospitality tradition through restaurants that attempt to recreate 14th and 15th-century dining experiences. Olde Hansa prepares food according to 15th-century recipes, notably excluding potatoes since they didn't arrive in Europe until much later, instead serving dishes like bear stew, barley, and mead. The restaurant creates an authentic atmosphere with rustic interiors, strolling musicians, and long tables with wooden benches.

Similarly, III Draakon, located in Tallinn's old courtroom, serves hearty elk broth, large pies with six different fillings, and grilled game sausages, reminiscent of what a humble medieval tavern might have offered. These modern establishments help visitors understand how taverns and inns became central to community life, serving as places where local events were celebrated, deals were struck, and gossip spread.

The enduring appeal of these medieval-style establishments demonstrates how the fundamental desire for a welcoming atmosphere, good company, and refreshing drink remains timeless, connecting modern visitors to Tallinn's rich mercantile past.
