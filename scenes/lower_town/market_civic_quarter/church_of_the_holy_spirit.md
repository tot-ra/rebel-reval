# Church of the Holy Spirit (PÃ¼ha Vaimu kirik)

**Location:** Market & Civic Quarter, Lower Town

A small but ancient church located near the Town Hall Square. Unlike the grander churches of Reval, this one serves the common people of the city.

## Description

The church is a simple, whitewashed building with a steep, tiled roof. Its most famous feature is the ornate, painted clock on its outer wall, the oldest public timepiece in Tallinn. Inside, the atmosphere is humble and serene, with a beautifully carved wooden interior.

## Characters

- **Parish Priest:** A kind, elderly priest who cares for the spiritual needs of his flock.
- **Common Folk:** The church is a gathering place for the ordinary citizens of Reval.

## Quests

- **Alms for the Poor:** The priest might ask the player to help collect donations or distribute food to the needy.
- **The Missing Bell:** The church's bell has been stolen, and the player is tasked with finding it before the next service.
- **A Sanctuary:** Someone on the run might seek sanctuary within the church, putting the player and the priest in a difficult position.
