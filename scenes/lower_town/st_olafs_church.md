# St. Olaf's Church (Oleviste kirik)

St. Olaf's Church in Tallinn, Estonia has a complex construction history that spans several centuries, making its exact "construction date" somewhat nuanced to pin down precisely.

## Original Construction

The church is believed to have been built in the 12th century. This original construction would have predated the Danish conquest of Tallinn in 1219, when the church served as the center for old Tallinn's Scandinavian community. The church's dedication to King Olaf II of Norway (Saint Olaf, 995-1030) reflects this early Scandinavian connection.

## First Written Records

The first known written records referring to St. Olaf's Church date back to 1267. This represents the earliest documented evidence of the church's existence, though the building itself is believed to be older than these records suggest.

## Major Reconstruction

The church underwent extensive rebuilding during the 14th century. This reconstruction was so significant that it essentially created much of the structure that exists today, making the 14th century another crucial date in the church's construction timeline.

## Historical Context

The uncertainty around the precise original construction date is typical for medieval buildings, where physical construction often preceded written documentation by decades or even centuries. The church's evolution from a 12th-century Scandinavian community center to a documented 13th-century structure that was then extensively rebuilt in the 14th century illustrates the dynamic nature of medieval church construction, where buildings were continuously modified and expanded over time.

This construction timeline also reflects Tallinn's changing political landscape, from its early Scandinavian period through Danish conquest to later medieval prosperity that enabled major architectural projects.
