# Dome School (Toompea Kool)

The Dome School in Tallinn was established in the 13th century at the cathedral. This makes it the oldest secondary school in Tallinn that continues to operate today.

## Historical Context

The Dome School was founded in connection with Tallinn's cathedral (Toomkirik), reflecting the medieval tradition of cathedral schools that served as important centers of learning throughout Europe. The establishment of the school in the 13th century places its founding during the period when Tallinn was developing as a significant medieval trading city.

## Significance

What makes the Dome School particularly notable is its continuous operation for over 700 years, maintaining its educational mission from medieval times to the present day. This longevity makes it not only the oldest secondary school in Tallinn but also one of the longest-running educational institutions in Estonia.

The exact construction date within the 13th century is not specified in the available information, but the school's connection to the cathedral suggests it was likely established as part of the broader ecclesiastical infrastructure that was being developed in Tallinn during this period of medieval urbanization.
