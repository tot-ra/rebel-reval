## Factions Present

### The Danish Crown ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° 
Toompea is the seat of the Danish Viceroy, who governs the Duchy of Estonia.
-   **Core NPC:** **Viceroy Konrad Preen**, the Danish governor (capitaneus Revalie). A weary, aging diplomat who is more interested in securing a comfortable retirement than in governing effectively. He is pragmatic and can be bribed or persuaded, but his loyalty is ultimately to a distant king who has all but forgotten this northern outpost.
