# LÃ¼hike Jalg (Short Leg) Gate

**Location:** Church & Monastery Quarter, Lower Town

This fortified gate tower connects the Lower Town to Toompea (the Upper Town). It is one of the two main routes to the seat of power, and as such, it is heavily guarded.

## Description

The gate is a tall, square tower with a narrow, steep stairway running through it. The gate is a choke point, and tensions between the nobles of the Upper Town and the merchants of the Lower Town can often be felt here.

## Characters

- **Danish Soldiers:** Guarding the gate to ensure the security of Toompea.
- **Nobles and Merchants:** Passing between the two parts of the city, often with disdain for each other.

## Quests

- **Access to Toompea:** The player may need to find a way to get past the guards, either by persuasion, stealth, or force.
- **A Message for a Noble:** The player could be tasked with delivering a message to a noble in Toompea, but the guards at the gate are under orders not to let anyone pass.
- **The Smuggler's Route:** There might be a secret way to bypass the gate, known only to a few.
