# Viru Gate

Viru Gate in Tallinn was constructed in the 14th century as part of the medieval city's defensive fortifications. The gate consists of two round towers that were built to defend the approaches to a drawbridge that spanned the moat in front of the city's ramparts.

## Historical Context and Purpose

The Viru Gate served as the main entrance to medieval Tallinn (then known as Reval) from the east side and was an integral component of the city's defensive wall system. As a barbican - an outer defensive structure - it was designed to provide additional protection for the city's main fortifications. The gate's strategic positioning made it a crucial checkpoint for controlling access to the medieval town.

## Architectural Features

The structure originally featured the characteristic medieval defensive architecture of the period, with two round towers flanking the entrance. These towers were specifically designed to provide defensive capabilities while serving as a controlled access point to the city. The existing towers underwent modifications at the turn of the 19th-20th centuries when a third tower was added to the structure.

## Evolution and Preservation

Over the centuries, Tallinn's defensive system expanded to include eight gates with multiple towers and connecting curtain walls. However, as the city modernized and transportation needs changed, several gates were demolished to accommodate developments like horse-drawn tram routes connecting the Old Market with Kadriorg. Fortunately, the corner towers of Viru Gate were preserved, and today they stand as one of the best-preserved examples of 14th-century defensive architecture in Tallinn.

The gate now serves as a symbolic entrance to Tallinn's UNESCO World Heritage Old Town, welcoming visitors to explore the medieval streets beyond while preserving its historical significance as a testament to the city's rich defensive heritage.
