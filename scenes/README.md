## üè∞ Setting & Exploration (scenes/levels) üåç
The game world is a condensed, semi-fictionalized representation of 14th-century Estonia. Locations are divided into two types: Core Locations, which are always accessible, and Dynamic Locations, whose state or availability changes dramatically with the start of the uprising (Phase 2).

### Core Locations (Always Accessible)
These locations form the backbone of the game world. While their atmosphere may change based on the "Living City" meters, they are always present and explorable.

-   **Toompea (Upper Town):**
    -   **Toompea Castle (Domberg):** The heavily guarded seat of Danish and Livonian power.
    -   **The Cathedral of Saint Mary:** The spiritual heart of the Livonian Order.
-   **The City of Reval (Lower Town):**
    -   **The Smith's Forge:** Your home base and workshop.
    -   **St. Olaf's Guild Hall:** The center of Hanseatic power and commerce.
    -   **The Whispering Market:** A hub for information, goods, and spies.
    -   **The Sunken Harbor District:** A maze of docks and smuggling tunnels.
-   **Livonian Order Strongholds:**
    -   **Wesenberg (Rakvere):** A key Order fortress and regional base.
    -   **Viljandi Castle (Fellin):** A formidable stronghold symbolizing the Order's military might.
-   **The Wider World:**
    -   **The Sacred Grove of Taara:** A hidden pagan sanctuary of immense natural power.
    -   **A Peasant Village (Harju County):** The heart of the Estonian resistance, simmering with rebellion.

### Dynamic & Event-Based Locations
These locations are tied directly to the historical events of the uprising and change significantly between Phase 1 and Phase 2.

-   **The Padise Monastery:**
    -   **Phase 1 (Before Uprising):** A functioning Cistercian monastery. A place of quiet contemplation, but also a source of quests and information. You might interact with monks who are sympathetic to the Estonian cause or loyal to the Order.
    -   **Phase 2 (During Uprising):** A smoking ruin and a key battleground. After the historical massacre, it becomes a haunted, dangerous location, filled with the ghosts of the slain monks and opportunistic looters.
-   **P√§rnu (Pernau):**
    -   **Phase 1:** A strategic coastal town focused on trade.
    -   **Phase 2:** The site of the "Battle of P√§rnu," a major open-field conflict zone.
-   **The Hill of the First Flame (Harju County):**
    -   **Phase 1:** An unremarkable, windswept hill.
    -   **Phase 2:** Becomes a sacred site of pilgrimage for the rebels after the signal fire for the uprising is lit here. A symbol of hope and defiance.
-   **The Rebel Kings' Camp:**
    -   **Phase 1:** Does not exist.
    -   **Phase 2:** Appears as a sprawling, makeshift war camp hidden in the forests. Becomes a central hub for the Harju Kings faction, where you can train, gather intelligence, and prepare for large-scale battles.
-   **The Swedish Outpost:**
    -   **Phase 1:** Inaccessible.
    -   **Phase 2:** Becomes accessible during the "Swedish Gambit" questline. A clandestine meeting point on the coast to negotiate for aid.
-   **Paldiski (R√•gervik):**
    -   **Phase 1:** A desolate, rocky coastline, known for shipwrecks and smugglers.
    -   **Phase 2:** Becomes a key strategic location for naval activities. The rebels may use it to await promised aid from Sweden, while the Vitalienbr√ºder pirates may use it as a base to plunder ships amidst the chaos.
-   **The Sacred Lake of Saaremaa:**
    -   **Phase 1:** Inaccessible.
    -   **Phase 2:** Becomes the final bastion of the rebellion in the late game. A mystical, fog-shrouded location for ancient rituals and a desperate last stand.
