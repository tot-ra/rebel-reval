### Dynamic & Event-Based Locations
These locations are tied directly to the historical events of the uprising and change significantly between Phase 1 and Phase 2.

-   **The Padise Monastery:**
    -   **Phase 1 (Before Uprising):** A functioning Cistercian monastery. A place of quiet contemplation, but also a source of quests and information. You might interact with monks who are sympathetic to the Estonian cause or loyal to the Order.

    -   **Phase 1:** A strategic coastal town focused on trade.
    -   **Phase 2:** The site of the "Battle of Pärnu," a major open-field conflict zone.
-   **The Hill of the First Flame (Harju County):**
    -   **Phase 1:** An unremarkable, windswept hill.
    -   **Phase 2:** Becomes a sacred site of pilgrimage for the rebels after the signal fire for the uprising is lit here. A symbol of hope and defiance.
-   **The Rebel Kings' Camp:**
    -   **Phase 1:** Does not exist.
    -   **Phase 2:** Appears as a sprawling, makeshift war camp hidden in the forests. Becomes a central hub for the Harju Kings faction, where you can train, gather intelligence, and prepare for large-scale battles.

-   **Paldiski (Rågervik):**
    -   **Phase 1:** A desolate, rocky coastline, known for shipwrecks and smugglers.
    -   **Phase 2:** Becomes a key strategic location for naval activities. The rebels may use it to await promised aid from Sweden, while the Vitalienbrüder pirates may use it as a base to plunder ships amidst the chaos.
-   **The Sacred Lake of Saaremaa:**
    -   **Phase 1:** Inaccessible.
    -   **Phase 2:** Becomes the final bastion of the rebellion in the late game. A mystical, fog-shrouded location for ancient rituals and a desperate last stand.
