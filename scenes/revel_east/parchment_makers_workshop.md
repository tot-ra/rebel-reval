### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a parchment maker's workshop in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The workshop is a small, single-story building, with stone walls and a thatched roof. A wooden rack for drying animal skins stands outside the workshop. The air around the workshop is thick with the smell of lime and decaying animal matter.

## What it's for

The Parchment Maker's Workshop is a place of smelly, laborious, but vital work. Here, animal skins are transformed into the smooth, durable parchment used by the scribes of the nearby Dominican Monastery. The process is long and unpleasant, involving soaking the skins in lime, scraping away the hair and flesh, and stretching them to dry. The workshop is essential for the preservation of knowledge and the creation of the beautiful illuminated manuscripts for which the monastery is known.
