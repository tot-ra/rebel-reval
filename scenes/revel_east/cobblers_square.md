### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a small, bustling square in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The square is paved with uneven cobblestones and surrounded by the timber-framed facades of adjoining buildings. In the center of the square, three simple wooden stalls are set up. Each stall has a workbench, a stool, and an array of shoemaking tools. Scraps of leather and worn-out shoes are scattered around the stalls. A large, leafy oak tree provides some shade to the square. The scene is depicted in a historically accurate 14th-century Northern European style, with clear, crisp lines and no modern elements.

## What it's for

Cobblers' Square is the go-to destination for the common folk of Reval to have their worn-out shoes repaired. In a time when new shoes are a luxury, the skilled cobblers of this square are essential for keeping the city's populace on its feet. The air is filled with the smell of leather and wax, and the sound of hammers tapping away at worn soles.
