A rough-hewn shack on the edge of the quarter, surrounded by stacks of firewood and the scent of pine.

### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a small, rustic shack in the eastern quarter of medieval Reval, circa 1343. The shack is built from rough, un-planed logs, with moss and lichen growing in the gaps. It has a simple, sloping roof made of wooden planks. A large chopping block with a woodsman's axe embedded in it sits prominently in front of the shack. Stacks of firewood of various sizes are piled high around the dwelling. A thin plume of smoke rises from a simple stone chimney.

## What it's for

The Woodcutter's Shack is the home and workplace of the man who supplies much of the quarter with firewood. It is a place of hard, physical labor, where logs are chopped, split, and stacked for sale. The woodcutter is a vital part of the community, especially during the long, cold winters.
