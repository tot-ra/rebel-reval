### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a small, single-story wooden house in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The house is located near the harbor and has a weathered, salt-stained appearance. A fishing net is draped over the railing of the small porch, and a pile of colorful fishing floats is stacked by the door.

## What it's for

The Net Maker's House is an essential part of Reval's fishing industry. Here, the nets that are vital for the city's fishermen are painstakingly made and mended. The house is a quiet place of patient, repetitive work, filled with the smell of the sea and the soft rustle of twine.
