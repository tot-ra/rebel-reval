### Visual Description for Image Prompt

An isometric view of a two-story building in medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. The ground floor is made of limestone, and the upper floor is timber-framed with wattle and daub infill. The building has a steep, gabled roof with red clay tiles. A pair of scissors is painted on a wooden sign that hangs above the door. The shop has a large, glass-paned window, which is a sign of prosperity. Bolts of colorful cloth can be seen through the window.

## What it's for

The Tailor's Workshop is a cut above the other artisans in the eastern quarter. While the weavers produce the rough cloth for the masses, the tailors craft the fine garments worn by the city's elite. The workshop is a place of precision and artistry, where expensive fabrics are transformed into fashionable clothing that serves as a status symbol for the wealthy merchants and nobles of Reval.
