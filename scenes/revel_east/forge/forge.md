### Music
- **Rhythmic, Industrial, Brooding:** Anvil strikes, bellows whoosh, grinding metal, low male choir, heavy percussion.
- **Tense, Confrontational, Resentful:** Sharp string accents, deep brass drones, pulsing timpani, distorted lute, aggressive male vocals.
- **Solitary, Reflective, Determined:** Solo cello melody, ambient synth pads, slow piano chords, echoing hammer blows, a single, sustained violin note.
- **Uprising, Hopeful, Rebellious:** Driving string ostinato, powerful brass fanfare, soaring female vocals, military snare drum rhythm, layered choir.
- **Mysterious, Secretive, Dangerous:** Pizzicato strings, woodwind whispers, soft, dissonant piano clusters, low, rumbling percussion, a lone flute melody.
