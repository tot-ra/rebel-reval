## ðŸ“– Core Narrative
The year is 1342. A fragile peace hangs over Reval, but the air is thick with resentment. The St. George's Night Uprising is a spark waiting to ignite.

"Reval Rebel" casts you as __Kalev__, a smith from the lower town who stands at the crossroads of history. You want nothing more than to be left alone, but the city itself is a powder keg. Estonian peasants whisper of rebellion, Hanseatic merchants tighten their grip, and the knights of the Livonian Order watch over all with an iron fist. You are dragged into the simmering conflict when a secret is entrusted to youâ€”a plan, a weapon, a truthâ€”that could either start the uprising or crush it before it begins.  

Caught between the ruthless Livonian Order, the scheming merchants, and the ancient, chaotic power of the land itself, you must decide where your loyalties lie. Your choices will determine not if the rebellion happens, but how.

Will you become the hero your people whisper about â€” a new "Kalevipoeg", or will you forge your own path to order and civilization through the chaos, using your wits and your hammer to survive? The choices you make will determine whether the rebellion becomes a footnote in history or the dawn of a new era.


## ðŸ¦¸ The Hero: Kalev the Smith
![](./img/user__idle.gif)

You are Kalev, an Estonian smith. To the German lords, you're just another pair of hands to shoe their horses. To your own people, you're a stubborn man with a strong back and a cynical tongue. But there's more to you than meets the eye.

- The Name of a Giant: Your name, is the same as the mythical giant-king. Your strength is unusual, and perhaps there's a flicker of ancient power in your bloodline.
- A Reluctant Rebel: You are not a hero by choice. Your dialogue can be witty, sarcastic, or grimly pragmatic, reflecting a man caught in events far larger than himself.
- A Smith's Hands: You see the world through the eyes of a craftsman. Your hammer is not just a tool; it's an extension of your will.
- You have access to supernatural powers. Unlock more by aligning with factions.

# Reval Rebel - Project Summary

## Gameplay Mechanics

The game features a dynamic day/night cycle:
*   **Day:** Players engage in crafting, commerce, and information gathering as Kalev the smith.
*   **Night:** Players undertake covert missions, engaging in stealth and combat to advance their faction's goals.

A key feature is the **"Living City"** system, where player actions influence meters for **Rebel Morale (Hope)** and **Civic Order (Fear)**. This creates a dynamic world that reacts to the player's choices, shifting the overall **Balance of Power** between the Rebel and Ruler factions.

## Combat System

Combat is built around a unique spell-forging system. Players can map up to 8 **Elements of Philosophy** (e.g., Fire, Order, Deception) to their keys. By combining these elements in sequences of up to four, players can creatively **forge** a vast array of spells and actions. The system allows for deep tactical flexibility, alongside traditional melee combat and the ability to lead a party of allies.

## Factions

The political landscape is divided into three groups:

*   **Ruling Factions:** Representing order and stability, these include the **Danish Crown**, the **Livonian Order**, and the **Hanseatic League**.
*   **Rebel Factions:** Fighting for freedom, these include the rural **Harju Kings**, the urban **Black Cloaks**, and the pagan **Cult of Metsik**.
*   **Neutral Factions:** Opportunistic groups with their own agendas, such as the **Republic of Novgorod & Pskov**, the **Brotherhood of Blackheads**, and the **VitalienbrÃ¼der** pirates.

Players must choose to align with either the Rulers or the Rebels, and their actions will build or break alliances with these factions.

## Story Progression

The narrative is structured in chapters that mirror the historical timeline of the uprising:
*   **Chapter 1 (The Simmering City):** Focuses on political intrigue and building alliances before the rebellion erupts.
*   **Chapter 2 (The Fire of Rebellion):** Begins on St. George's Night and focuses on open warfare and large-scale battles.
*   **Chapter 3 (The Livonian Crusade):** Expands the conflict to new regions.
*   **Epilogue:** A poignant mini-game set years later, revealing the long-term consequences of the conflict and the arrival of the plague.
