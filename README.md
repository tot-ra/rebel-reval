## üé≠ Historical Context
The State of Estonia in 1342: On paper, Northern Estonia is the Duchy of Estonia, a dominion of the Danish Crown, ruled by a viceroy from Toompea Castle. In reality, Danish power is a hollow shell. The true authority lies with a web of competing interests:

- The German Vassals: Feudal lords who control the land and its people, loyal to the Danish king only when it suits them.
- The Livonian Order: A powerful, semi-independent military order of German knights who act as the region's de facto army and landlords. They have their own agenda and often operate in defiance of the Danish crown.
- The Hanseatic League: The wealthy German merchants of Reval, who operate with a high degree of autonomy and are primarily concerned with protecting their trade routes and profits.

This fractured power structure has created a powder keg of resentment and ambition, where the native Estonian population is caught between a distant king, foreign knights, and wealthy merchants, all of whom see the land and its people as a resource to be exploited.

The Seeds of Rebellion: The St. George's Night Uprising is not a sudden event, but the culmination of decades of simmering resentment. The key grievances include:
- Heavy Taxation: The Danish Crown, weakened and distracted by its own internal politics, has imposed increasingly heavy taxes on the Estonian population to fund its distant ambitions.
- Cultural and Religious Oppression: The German-speaking ruling class and the Catholic Church have systematically suppressed Estonian culture, language, and pagan beliefs.
- Economic Exploitation: The Hanseatic merchants of Reval control the flow of trade, enriching themselves while the local population sees little benefit.
- Loss of Land and Freedom: The rights of free Estonian peasants have been steadily eroded, with many forced into serfdom by the German feudal lords.


## üìñ Core Narrative
The year is 1342. A fragile peace hangs over Reval, but the air is thick with resentment. The St. George's Night Uprising is a spark waiting to ignite.

"Reval Rebel" casts you as Kalev, a smith from the lower town who stands at the crossroads of history. You want nothing more than to be left alone, but the city itself is a powder keg. Estonian peasants whisper of rebellion, Hanseatic merchants tighten their grip, and the knights of the Livonian Order watch over all with an iron fist.

You are dragged into the simmering conflict when a secret is entrusted to you‚Äîa plan, a weapon, a truth‚Äîthat could either start the uprising or crush it before it begins. Caught between the ruthless Livonian Order, the scheming merchants, and the ancient, chaotic power of the land itself, you must decide where your loyalties lie. Your choices will determine not if the rebellion happens, but how.

Caught between the ruthless Livonian Order, the scheming Hanseatic merchants, and the ancient, chaotic power of the land itself, you must decide where your loyalties lie. Will you become the hero your people whisper about‚Äîa new "Kalevipoeg"‚Äîor will you forge your own path through the chaos, using your wits and your hammer to survive? The choices you make will determine whether the rebellion becomes a footnote in history or the dawn of a new era.


## ü¶∏ The Hero: Kalev the Smith
You are Kalev, an Estonian smith. To the German lords, you're just another pair of hands to shoe their horses. To your own people, you're a stubborn man with a strong back and a cynical tongue. But there's more to you than meets the eye.

- The Name of a Giant: Your name, "Kalev," is the same as the mythical giant-king of Estonia. Some see it as a prophecy, others as a cruel joke. Your strength is unusual, and perhaps there's a flicker of ancient power in your bloodline.
- A Smith's Hands: You see the world through the eyes of a craftsman. Your hammer is not just a tool; it's an extension of your will. You can feel the secrets in stone and the stories in steel.
- A Reluctant Rebel: You are not a hero by choice. The uprising is a nuisance that has overturned your life. Your journey is one of survival, but your actions might accidentally inspire hope... or bring about greater ruin. Your dialogue can be witty, sarcastic, or grimly pragmatic, reflecting a man caught in events far larger than himself.
- Spiritual force. You have supernatural powers. Depending on the factions, you can align either with polytheistic or with monotheistic powers.


## ‚öîÔ∏è Factions
You can ally, betray, or infiltrate these political forces. Your actions will determine the fate of Reval and the future of Estonia. Each faction offers unique quests, abilities, and endings.

### Ruling Factions

These factions represent the established, foreign powers ruling over Reval. They offer stability, power, and advanced resources, but at the cost of natives freedom.

-   **The Danish Crown** üá©üá∞ 
    -   **Motivation:** To maintain their tenuous hold on the Duchy of Estonia, extract as much tax revenue as possible, and prevent the Livonian Order from seizing full control. They are a fading power, ruling in name only.
    -   **Core NPC:** **Viceroy Konrad Preen**, the Danish governor (capitaneus Revalie). A weary, aging diplomat who is more interested in securing a comfortable retirement than in governing effectively. He is pragmatic and can be bribed or persuaded, but his loyalty is ultimately to a distant king who has all but forgotten this northern outpost.

-   **The Hanseatic League** üá™üá∫
    -   **Motivation:** Profit and control. The League's merchants, led by the powerful guilds of Reval, see the uprising as a threat to their trade monopolies. They are not warriors, but their wealth gives them immense influence. They fund the Livonian Order, bribe city officials, and use their extensive network of spies to protect their interests.
    -   **Core NPC:** **J√ºrgen von League**, a wealthy and ruthless amber merchant who unofficially speaks for the League. He is a master of economic warfare, offering you advanced technology, access to smuggling rings, and vast sums of gold in exchange for services that secure the League's dominance.

-   **The Livonian Order** ‚ú†
    -   **Motivation:** Faith and fury. The Order sees itself as the sword of Christendom, tasked with rooting out paganism and imposing divine order on a savage land. They are the true military power in the region, and they view the Danish Crown with contempt and the Estonians as little more than heathens to be converted or crushed.
    -   **Core NPCs:** **Brother Burchard von Dreileben**, a zealous and battle-hardened knight of the Order. He is a formidable warrior and a charismatic leader, offering you access to elite combat training, blessed weaponry, and the chance to fight for what he believes is a righteous cause. He is unyielding in his faith and merciless to his enemies.
        - Brother Goswin von Herike - commander in Viljandi
        - Arnd von Herke

### The Rebel Factions

These factions represent the native Estonian resistance. They are outgunned and outmaneuvered, but they have the support of the people and a deep connection to the land itself.

-   **The Four Kings** 
    -   **Motivation:** Freedom. A grassroots rebellion born in the fields and workshops of Harju County. They are bakers, smiths, and fishermen who have been pushed to the breaking point by years of oppression. They lack a unified leadership and a clear plan, but their anger is real, and their numbers are growing.
    -   **Core NPC:** **Lembit Helme**, a charismatic and impulsive blacksmith who has become the reluctant leader of the Reval uprising. He is a man of action, not words, and he offers you a place at the heart of the rebellion, fighting for the freedom of your people.

-   **The Pagan Cult of Metsik** üçÄ
    -   **Motivation:** The Old Ways. A secretive cult of forest-dwellers who worship the ancient Estonian gods. They see the Christian invaders as a plague upon the land and believe that the uprising is a chance to restore the old ways. Their magic is powerful and chaotic, drawn from the sacred groves and the spirits of the earth.
    -   **Core NPC:** **Ellen Luik**, the enigmatic high priestess of the cult. She is a powerful seer and a master of spirit magic, offering you access to ancient rituals, animal allies, and the raw, untamed power of the land itself. Her motives are cryptic, and her loyalty is to the spirits, not to any mortal cause. She seems to tell stories to children that surround her 

### The Neutral Factions

These factions are not directly involved in the conflict between the Empire and the Rebels, but they have their own agendas and can be powerful allies or dangerous enemies.

-   **The Veiled Council** üï∑Ô∏è
    -   **Motivation:** The long game. A secret society of Reval's oldest and wealthiest German families who believe that both the Danes and the Livonian Order are temporary. They manipulate events from the shadows, seeking to create a new, independent state under their own control. They are masters of espionage, assassination, and political intrigue.
    -   **Core NPC:** **"Mart the Weaver"** a mysterious figure who communicates only through coded messages and intermediaries. They offer you access to a network of spies, saboteurs, and assassins, but their true motives are always hidden, and their loyalty is only to the Council's ultimate ambition.

-   **The Vitalienbr√ºder** üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
    -   **Motivation:** Plunder and chaos. The remnants of a once-powerful pirate brotherhood, now reduced to a scattered band of raiders and mercenaries. They have no loyalty to any flag and are interested only in profiting from the chaos of the uprising. They are masters of naval combat and can be hired to attack shipping, smuggle goods, or create diversions.
    -   **Core NPC:** **"Ironhand" St√∂rtebeker**, a grizzled and pragmatic pirate captain who leads the largest band of Vitalienbr√ºder in the Baltic. He is a man of his word, but his word is always backed by a sharp axe and a lust for gold.

-   **The Pskov Agents** üêÜ
    -   **Motivation:** Destabilization. The Republic of Pskov is a rising power, caught between the ambitions of the Livonian Order and the dominance of Novgorod. They see the uprising as an opportunity to weaken their rivals and expand their own influence in the region. They are masters of sabotage, espionage, and guerrilla warfare.
    -   **Core NPC:** **–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ö–æ–ª**, a cunning and resourceful Pskovian agent who operates under the cover of a fur trapper. He perfectly knows Reval streets. He offers you access to a network of spies, saboteurs, and assassins, as well as intelligence on the movements of the Livonian Order.

-   **The Novgorod Republic Trade Delegation** üåû
    -   **Motivation:** Security and profit. The powerful Republic of Novgorod is primarily concerned with protecting its lucrative trade routes through the region. They are officially neutral, but they will secretly support whichever side they believe is most likely to ensure the stability of the region and the continued flow of goods. They have vast resources and can provide you with money, political influence, and a safe escape route if the uprising fails.
    -   **Core NPC:** **–ò—É–∞–Ω–∞ –ü–æ–¥–∞—è–ª—å–Ω–∞—è**, the head of the Novgorodian trade delegation in Reval. She is a shrewd and calculating diplomat who is always looking for an angle to exploit. She can be a powerful ally, but her support always comes at a price.



## üè∞ Setting & Exploration
The game world is a condensed, semi-fictionalized representation of 14th-century Estonia, centered around the city of Reval (Tallinn). The following 12 scenes will serve as the primary locations for the game's missions:

### The City of Reval (Lower Town)

- **The Smith's Forge:** Your home base. A cluttered, fire-lit space filled with the tools of your trade, which gradually evolves into a clandestine headquarters for the rebellion.
- **St. Olaf's Guild Hall** A grand, timber-framed hall where the Hanseatic merchants conduct their business. A place of wealth, power, and political intrigue.
- **The Whispering Market** A bustling, open-air market filled with vendors, beggars, and spies. The best place to gather rumors or disappear into a crowd.
- The Sunken Harbor District A maze of rickety docks, shadowy warehouses, and secret smuggling tunnels. The lifeblood of the city and a hotbed of illicit activity.
- Toompea Castle (Domberg) The seat of Danish power, a heavily guarded fortress patrolled by Livonian knights. The ultimate symbol of foreign domination.
- The Cathedral of Saint Mary A soaring Gothic cathedral, the spiritual heart of the Livonian Order. A place of serene beauty and oppressive authority.


### Wesenberg (Rakvere)
- Livonian order home base


### The Wider World

- **The Sacred Grove of Taara:** A hidden, ancient forest sanctuary where pagan rituals are performed. A place of immense natural power and deep mystery.
- **A Peasant Village (Harju County):** A small, impoverished rural settlement on the brink of open rebellion. The heart of the Estonian resistance.
- **The Padise Monastery Ruins:** The haunted, burned-out shell of a Cistercian monastery destroyed in the early days of the uprising. A grim testament to the brutality of the conflict.
- **The Field of Crosses:** A desolate, windswept battlefield where a previous uprising was brutally crushed. A place of ghosts and warnings.
- **The Swamps of Saaremaa:** The last bastion of the Estonian rebels. A treacherous, fog-shrouded landscape where the final, desperate battles of the uprising will be fought.
-   **The Frozen Sea:** A vast, ice-bound expanse that serves as both a barrier and a bridge. A place for a final, desperate confrontation under a winter sky.


## üßô Gameplay Mechanics

## üó∫Ô∏è A Tale of Two Phases: From Intrigue to Open War
The game is divided into two distinct phases, each with a different feel and set of objectives.

- Phase 1: The Simmering City (Days 1-8)
- Gameplay Focus: Political intrigue, stealth, and character development. This phase is about building your power and choosing your allies.
- Player Goal: Navigate the treacherous social landscape of Reval. Your actions will build your reputation with different factions, unlocking unique abilities and story paths. Every choice you make determines who will stand with you‚Äîand who will stand against you‚Äîwhen the city finally erupts.
- Narrative Arc: This phase is a slow-burn thriller. You'll uncover conspiracies, perform secret missions for different factions, and make difficult choices that have no clear right answer. The "Living City" meters (Hope, Fear, Chaos) are your primary measure of progress.

- Phase 2: The Fire of Rebellion (Days 9-12)
- Gameplay Focus: Open warfare, tactical combat, and large-scale battles. This phase begins on St. George's Night, April 23, 1343.
- Player Goal: Survive and lead your chosen faction through the historical events of the uprising. Your missions will be based on the real-life timeline of the rebellion:
- The Siege of Reval: Help the Estonian rebels in their attempt to take the city, or side with the Livonian Order to break the siege.
- The Battle of P√§rnu: Engage in a major field battle against the knights.
- The Swedish Gambit: Attempt to secure aid from Sweden, or sabotage the rebels' efforts to do so.
- Narrative Arc: This phase is a desperate, action-packed struggle for survival. The choices you made in Phase 1 will have dramatic consequences, determining which missions are available to you and what resources you have at your disposal.


### The Living City: A World That Remembers
Your actions don't just complete quests; they ripple through the city of Reval, changing the world around you. The city's state is tracked through three interconnected meters:

- Hope: Represents the morale of the Estonian rebels and common folk.
- Increases with: Public acts of defiance (humiliating a knight), successful sabotage, distributing aid to the poor.
- Effects: More NPCs offer you shelter or information. Rebel graffiti appears on walls. Bards sing coded songs of your deeds. Faction "The Black Cloaks" becomes bolder.
- Fear: Reflects the grip of the Livonian Order and Hanseatic elite.
- Increases with: Getting caught, failing missions publicly, assassinations, brutal street fights.
- Effects: More guards patrol the streets. Harsher curfews are enforced. Shops close early. NPCs become tight-lipped and suspicious.
- Chaos: Measures the level of open conflict and instability in the city.
- Increases with: Starting riots, pitting factions against each other, large-scale destruction.
- Effects: Faction skirmishes break out in the streets. Looting opportunities arise. The city's elite may hire mercenaries, creating new, dangerous foes. The Undercity becomes a hotbed of frantic activity.

These meters are not mutually exclusive. A city can be both hopeful and chaotic, leading to a full-blown, bloody revolution. Or it can be fearful and chaotic, descending into a brutal, lawless free-for-all. Your actions as Kalev directly shape the kind of rebellion that unfolds.

### The Gameplay Loop: A Rebel's Day
The game operates on a dynamic day/night cycle, where each phase offers different opportunities and dangers, creating a core loop of preparation, action, and consequence. This loop remains consistent across both phases of the game, but the stakes and mission types will change dramatically.

- Day (The Smith's Mask): By day, you are Kalev the smith. The city is under the watchful eye of the Livonian Order.
- Crafting & Commerce: Fulfill orders for townsfolk and even the overlords to earn coin and gather intelligence. Crafting a perfect horseshoe for a knight's warhorse might reveal weaknesses in their patrols.
- Information Gathering: The streets are alive with gossip. Talk to merchants, beggars, and priests. Overhear conversations, bribe officials, and piece together the city's secrets.
- Preparation: Use your earnings and materials to upgrade your forge, craft better gear, or set up traps and dead-drops for your nighttime activities.

- Night (The Rebel's Shadow): When the sun sets, the rebellion's true work begins.
- Missions & Sabotage: Undertake quests for the various factions. Sabotage a Hanseatic crane to disrupt their supply lines, replace a knight's banner with a pig's head, or lead a jailbreak from the city dungeon.
- Exploration & Rituals: Explore forbidden areas like the Undercity or venture into the sacred groves to perform rituals that grant you new powers. The city's layout might change at night, with new paths opening and old ones becoming more dangerous.
- Action & Combat: Engage in fast-paced, top-down combat inspired by games like *Nox*. Use your smith's hammer, crafted weapons, and ancestral magic to overcome patrols, rival agents, and things that lurk in the dark.

### The Grudge System: Turning Failure into Vengeance
Defeat in "Reval Rebel" is not an end, but a new beginning. When Kalev is defeated, he doesn't just respawn. He awakens with a **Grudge**, a new, personal objective aimed at the person or faction that defeated him. This system transforms failure from a frustrating setback into a narrative and gameplay opportunity.

- How Grudges are Generated: A Grudge is generated whenever you are defeated in combat. The nature of the Grudge depends on who defeated you and where (e.g., defeated by a named knight, captured by the city guard).
- Grudge Mechanics: A Grudge appears as a unique quest. The target of your Grudge becomes a more significant presence in the world, and the Grudge unlocks unique gameplay paths to resolve the conflict.
- Resolving a Grudge: Completing a Grudge quest yields significant rewards, including unique loot, faction standing, and a major boost to the **Hope** meter.

### World-Impacting Abilities: Leaving Your Mark
Certain high-tier abilities, particularly faction ultimates, are designed to have a permanent or semi-permanent impact on the game world. These actions are significant and will cause major shifts in faction power, NPC behavior, and the physical environment. For example, the Pagan Cult's `Heart of the Forest` can create a permanent "Pagan Scar" on a city district, altering its appearance and the balance of power within it.

### Core Feature: AI-Driven NPCs
To create a truly living and unpredictable world, every NPC in Reval, from the highest-ranking knight to the lowliest beggar, is controlled by an independent AI model. This system moves beyond traditional, scripted behavior, allowing for emergent narratives and a deeply reactive game world.

- Dynamic Goals & Schedules: Each NPC has their own set of goals, fears, and relationships. A merchant's primary goal is profit, but he might also fear the Livonian Order and have a secret sympathy for the rebellion. These motivations dictate their daily schedules and how they react to the player and the changing state of the city.
- Reactive Dialogue: NPC conversations are not chosen from a pre-written tree. Instead, their responses are generated in real-time based on:
- Your Actions: If you've been seen brawling in the streets, NPCs will comment on it. If you've been generous, they'll thank you.
- The City State: In a city gripped by **Fear**, NPCs will be tight-lipped and suspicious. In a city filled with **Hope**, they will be more open and willing to share information.
- Their Personal Relationship with You: An NPC you've helped will greet you warmly, while one you've wronged will be hostile or dismissive.
- Emergent Behavior: Because NPCs are not on fixed scripts, they can react to events in unpredictable ways. A riot might cause a merchant to hire extra guards, or a food shortage might lead a normally law-abiding citizen to steal. This creates a world that feels alive and constantly evolving.
- Integration with Gameplay Systems: The AI-driven NPCs are the engine that drives the "Living City." Your attempts to manipulate the **Hope**, **Fear**, and **Chaos** meters are essentially attempts to influence the collective mood and behavior of the city's AI inhabitants.

## ‚ö° Character Abilities & Magic
Abilities are divided into two main categories: the **Ancestral Magic Tree** (Kalev's innate skills) and **Faction-Specific Abilities** (unlocked through alignment).

### Ancestral Magic Tree: The Smith's Legacy
These abilities are unique to Kalev, reflecting his lineage and his craft. This tree is divided into two branches: **Runic Forging** and **Primal Power**.

- Tiers: `R√§√§kiv Raud (Talking Iron)`, `Runic Inscription`, `Sacred Scrap Analysis`, `Hybrid Forging`, `The Living Forge`.
- Branch 2: Primal Power (Combat & Inner Strength): Represents the awakening of the dormant, giant-like power within Kalev's bloodline.
- Tiers: `Karuj√µud (Bear Strength)`, `Hundis√µnad (Wolf Words)`, `Earth-Sense`, `Spirit Shield`, `Kalev's Echo`.

### Faction-Specific Ability Trees
