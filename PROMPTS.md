## The Hingepuu (Soul Tree)

### Core Concept
The Hingepuu is a visual metaphor for the player's soul (psyche). It is an ancient, colossal oak tree existing in a dreamlike, ethereal space. Its appearance is a direct reflection of the player's inner balance, choices, and spiritual health. The overall mood should be mystical, serene, and slightly melancholic, evoking the deep, ancient forests of 14th-century Estonia.

### General Art Prompt
**"Epic digital painting, mystical and ancient, of the Hingepuu, the Soul Tree. The tree is a colossal, gnarled oak, its branches reaching into a twilight sky filled with faint stars and nebulae. The art style should be a blend of photorealism and fantasy, inspired by the works of ZdzisÅ‚aw BeksiÅ„ski for mood and Albert Bierstadt for scale and light. The lighting is ethereal, emanating from the tree itself and the spiritual "Hearths" located on it. The atmosphere is misty and dreamlike, with deep shadows and soft, glowing highlights. The setting is a primordial Estonian bog, with dark, reflective water pools at the tree's base."**

### Visualizing the Seven Hearths

1.  **Hearth of Roots (Juure Kolde):**
    *   **Visuals:** A network of massive, glowing taproots in a dark cavern beneath the main tree. The light is a warm, amber glow, pulsing gently like a slow heartbeat. In a balanced state, the roots are thick and strong, covered in soft moss. In an unbalanced state, they are withered, cracked, and shrouded in a fearful, dark mist.
    *   **Prompt:** "Subterranean view of the Hingepuu's roots. Massive, ancient roots glowing with a warm, amber light, forming a cavernous space. Ethereal mist clings to the ground. The mood is one of deep security and ancient stability."

2.  **Hearth of the Heart (SÃ¼dame Kolde):**
    *   **Visuals:** A hollow at the base of the trunk where the tree's sap flows in gentle, bioluminescent rivers of silver and blue. The space is filled with floating motes of light. In an unbalanced state, the sap is stagnant, dark, and murky.
    *   **Prompt:** "Inside a hollow at the base of a colossal oak. Rivers of glowing, silver-blue sap flow along the curved walls. The air is filled with floating, sparkling motes of light. A sense of calm, creative energy."

3.  **Hearth of the Sun (PÃ¤ikese Kolde):**
    *   **Visuals:** A large, sun-dappled platform built into the main trunk, high above the ground. Sunlight, even in the twilight world, seems to concentrate here. A spectral anvil might rest in the center. In an unbalanced state, this area is scorched, with embers glowing in the bark.
    *   **Prompt:** "A wide, sturdy platform on the trunk of a giant oak tree. Warm, golden sunlight filters through the canopy above, creating dramatic god-rays. The view looks out over a vast, misty forest. The mood is one of power, will, and potential."

4.  **Hearth of the Chest (Rinna Kolde):**
    *   **Visuals:** A vibrant, flourishing branch thick with glowing flora unique to the inner worldâ€”luminous moss, flowers that bloom and wilt with a breath. Small, friendly light spirits could flit between the leaves. In an unbalanced state, the branch is covered in sharp thorns and parasitic, dark vines.
    *   **Prompt:** "A massive, life-filled branch on a mystical tree. The branch is covered in glowing moss and bioluminescent flowers. The lighting is soft and green, creating a feeling of vibrant life and compassion."

5.  **Hearth of the Throat (Kurgu Kolde):**
    *   **Visuals:** A high, windswept branch where ethereal ribbons of light, like aurora borealis, flow with the wind, creating a constant, low hum or melody. The wind itself is visible as currents of light. In an unbalanced state, the winds are a chaotic storm.
    *   **Prompt:** "A high branch on a giant tree, silhouetted against a twilight sky. Visible currents of wind, glowing with the colors of the aurora borealis, flow through the leaves, creating a sense of sound and expression."

6.  **Hearth of the Brow (Laup Kolde):**
    *   **Visuals:** A perch at the very top of the tree, above the main canopy. It offers a clear, unobstructed view of the star-filled cosmos. The stars seem close enough to touch. In an unbalanced state, this area is shrouded in a thick, disorienting fog.
    *   **Prompt:** "View from the absolute top of a colossal world tree. Below is a sea of clouds and leaves. Above is a breathtaking, crystal-clear view of the Milky Way and swirling nebulae. The mood is one of immense clarity, wisdom, and perspective."

7.  **Hearth of the Crown (Krooni Kolde):**
    *   **Visuals:** This is not on the tree, but is the spiritual source of light in the sky above itâ€”a softly glowing star, a miniature sun, or a serene moon. It is the focal point the entire tree reaches for. In an unbalanced state, it could be a dim, flickering light or a dark void.
    *   **Prompt:** "Looking up from a mystical tree into a twilight cosmos. A single, brilliant, and serene star hangs directly above, bathing the scene in a gentle, divine light. It represents enlightenment and connection to the universe."
