## Inspirations
Witcher, Hades, Fallout, Disco Elysium, Magicka, WoW, Skyrim

## Game pillars and inspirations
- Gameplay
    - Short 30-min replayability sessions (Hades)
    - Pixel graphics (HOMM3)
    - NO scene or character ability gatings
- Character
    - Mind-and-body balance. Depth of action and fun is similar to depth of role playing, world building and immersion
    - Ego/self as NPC (Disco Elysium)
    - Fun fighting with combinatorics and emergent complexity (Magicka, WoW)
    - NO Character customization
    - NO Amnesia
- Story
    - Character is NOT saving the world. He is navigating through complex political and ethical situations to better understand himself.
    - World reacts to choices - scenes, characters etc. (Fallout)
- World
    - Historical __if possible__
    - Detailed videos
    - unique enemies (no critters/boss separation)
    - Can include R-rated content (language, violence, gore, sexual)
    - NO Open world (with nothing in it). Instead its set of maps/scenes that user can travel to
- Politics
    - History reflecting modern world politics. Similar topics
    - Everyone thinks they are right
    - Faction alignments (WoW, Skyrim)
    - Different NPCs views within factions
- Quests
    - No right solution / Gray moral. Often no correct way. (Witcher)
    - AI-driven NPCs
    - Some roleplay (choices affecting the story)
    - Relatively big world for exploration and side-quests
    - Non-linearity in quests
