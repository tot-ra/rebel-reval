## Game Pillars and Inspirations

### Gameplay
- **Core Loop:** A compelling day/night cycle.
    - **Day:** Focus on crafting, trading, information gathering, and social interaction. A time for preparation and strategy.
    - **Night:** Focus on stealth, combat, and covert missions. A time for action and consequence.
- **Combat System:** A unique spell-forging system that encourages creativity and tactical depth.
    - **Combinatorial Magic:** Players can combine up to four "Elements of Philosophy" (e.g., Fire, Order, Deception) to create a vast array of spells and actions, similar to *Magicka*'s emergent spellcasting.
    - **Synergistic Combat:** Melee combat, spell-forging, and party-based tactics should all be viable and interconnected.
- **Replayability:** Designed for short, meaningful sessions with high replay value, inspired by *Hades*. Each run should feel different due to the "Living City" system and branching narratives.
- **No Gating:** No arbitrary gating of scenes or abilities. Player progression should be tied to their choices and actions, not artificial barriers.

### Character
- **The Internal Struggle:** The player character, Kalev, is not a blank slate. His internal conflict is a core mechanic.
    - **Ego as NPC:** Kalev's inner thoughts, doubts, and convictions are represented as an "Ego" NPC, similar to *Disco Elysium*. This NPC will challenge the player's choices and offer different perspectives.
    - **Mind-and-Body Balance:** The player's actions should have a tangible impact on Kalev's mental state, which in turn affects his abilities and interactions with the world.
- **Fixed Protagonist:** No character customization. The story is about Kalev, a specific person with a history and a role in the world.
- **No Amnesia:** Kalev knows who he is and what he's done. The story is about his future, not his past.

### Story
- **Personal, Not Epic:** The story is not about saving the world. It's about a man navigating a brutal conflict and trying to understand his place in it.
- **Consequence-Driven Narrative:** The world and its inhabitants should react realistically to the player's choices, creating a branching narrative with no clear "good" or "evil" path (inspired by *The Witcher* and *Fallout*)
- **Historical Fiction:** The story is grounded in the historical St. George's Night Uprising, but takes creative liberties to explore themes of freedom, oppression, and identity. (inspired by Kingdom Come Deliverance)

### World
- **A Living City:** The city of Reval is the heart of the game. It should feel alive and reactive.
    - **Hub-Based Exploration:** The world is a series of interconnected scenes and maps, not a seamless open world. This allows for more detailed and meaningful locations.
    - **Atmospheric and Moody:** The world should be dark, gritty, and atmospheric, reflecting the harsh realities of 14th-century life.
- **Unique Enemies:** No generic "critters." Every enemy should be a person with their own motivations and place in the world.
- **Mature Themes:** The game will not shy away from R-rated content, including violence, gore, and complex ethical dilemmas.

### Politics
- **Factional Warfare:** The core conflict is between the Ruling Factions and the Rebel Factions.
    - **Dynamic Alliances:** The player's actions will build or break alliances with various sub-factions, each with their own goals and agendas.
    - **Moral Ambiguity:** Every faction believes they are in the right. There are no clear heroes or villains.
- **Modern Resonance:** The political themes of the game should reflect modern-day issues of power, identity, and resistance.
    - Oppression of imperial power based on language or beliefs.
    - Lack of self-control of masses and violence.
    - The role of misinformation and propaganda in shaping public opinion.
    - The tension between individual freedom and collective security.
    - The psychological toll of occupation and resistance.
    - Economic inequality and exploitation as drivers of conflict.

### Quests
- **Gray Morality:** Quests should have no easy answers. The player will be forced to make difficult choices with unforeseen consequences.
- **AI-Driven NPCs:** NPCs should have their own lives, schedules, and motivations. They should feel like real people, not just quest-givers.
- **Non-Linear Design:** Quests should be non-linear, with multiple paths to completion.

### The Living City System
- **Core Mechanic:** The "Living City" system is a core pillar of the game. It tracks the state of Reval through three meters:
    - **Hope (Rebel Morale):** Represents the strength and determination of the rebellion.
    - **Fear (Civic Order):** Represents the grip of the ruling powers on the city.
    - **Balance of Power:** A measure of the overall control of the city, influenced by Hope and Fear.
- **Dynamic World:** The state of these meters will have a tangible impact on the game world, affecting everything from NPC behavior to the availability of quests and resources.
- **Player-Driven Change:** The player's actions are the primary driver of the Living City system. Every choice, every mission, every interaction will shift the balance of power.
