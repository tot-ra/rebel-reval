# Kratt

## Visual Description
- **Clothes / Body:** Constructed from hay, old bones, and assorted farming tools (scythes, pitchforks). Its form is a twisted, ragged humanoid shape, covered in dried straw that hangs in tattered strips. The hay is a dull golden‑brown, the bones a bleached ivory, and the metal parts rusted black. Its eyes are hollow sockets glowing faintly with an eerie amber light.
- **Age:** Appears ageless; its construction is tied to the moment of creation.
- **Hair:** None; the “hair” is the frayed strands of hay that sway with each movement.
- **Physical Build:** Roughly human‑sized, lanky, with spindly limbs that end in crude, scythe‑like hands.

## Motivations
The Kratt exists solely to serve the soul that bound it. It seeks to fulfill the commands of its master, driven by the stolen soul’s lingering desire for purpose. If left unchecked, it will act with ruthless efficiency, often disregarding morality.

## Ties & Relationships
- **Allies:** Its master (any NPC or player who performed the binding ritual). Often allied with the Cult of Metsik, who value such constructs.
- **Enemies:** The Livonian Order (who view it as an abomination), villagers who fear it, and any creature that threatens its master.
- **Initial View of the Main Player (Kalek):** The Kratt will assess Kalek’s intentions; if Kalek appears as a potential master, it may attempt to bind him, otherwise it will act as a hostile obstacle.

## History (Biography)
In Estonian folklore, a Kratt is created when a folk‑smith steals a soul and binds it to a heap of hay and tools, animating the construct. Historically, such beings were rumored to guard secret caches of grain or to be used as mercenaries by desperate rebels. In the game world, the Cult of Metsik has revived the practice to forge obedient guardians for the uprising.

## Daily Routines
Kratts do not sleep. They remain stationed near the location where they were bound—often a hidden grove, a farmstead, or a rebel hideout—awaiting orders. When idle, they shuffle aimlessly, their straw rustling in the wind.
