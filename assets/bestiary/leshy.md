# Leshy (The Forest Guardian)

## Visual Description
- **Body:** A towering entity of twisted wood, vines, and leaves, standing roughly 8 meters tall. Its bark‑like skin is a deep, moss‑green with patches of lichen and blooming fungi. Branches sprout from its shoulders and head, forming a crown of foliage that rustles even in still air. Glowing amber eyes peer from within a hollowed trunk‑face.
- **Age:** Ancient, said to have been awakened with the oldest sacred groves of Estonia.
- **Hair:** N/A – its “hair” is a tangle of hanging vines and moss.
- **Physical Build:** Massive, rooted in the earth, yet able to stride silently through the forest. Its limbs end in claw‑like roots that can grasp or smash.

## Motivations
The Leshy protects the sanctity of the ancient forests and the spirits within. It seeks to keep the balance between nature and the encroaching forces of civilization, especially the Order and foreign merchants. It will aid those who respect the woods and punish those who desecrate them.

## Ties & Relationships
- **Allies:** The Cult of Metsik, the spirit of the World Tree, forest‑dwelling creatures (wolves, bears, birds). Occasionally assists rebel scouts who move through the woods without harming nature.
- **Enemies:** The Livonian Order, the Hanseatic merchants, any faction that conducts large‑scale logging or sacrilege. Also wary of the Cult of Vanapagan if they perform dark rites.
- **Initial View of the Main Player (Kalev):** The Leshy observes Kalev’s actions; if he shows reverence for the forest, the Leshy may offer guidance or aid. If he harms the woods, the Leshy becomes hostile.

## History (Biography)
Legends tell of the Leshy emerging from the heart of the ancient oak that once stood at the center of the Sacred Grove. When the first settlers cut down the tree, the spirit awoke, taking the form of a guardian to avenge the loss and to ensure the forest’s survival. Over centuries, it has become a mythic figure whispered among peasants and feared by the Order’s scouts.

## Daily Routines
The Leshy rarely leaves its domain. It spends days rooted, listening to the wind and the whispers of the trees, and nights moving silently among the trunks, tending to injured wildlife, coaxing new growth, and dispersing seeds. When threatened, it can uproot itself and stride across the land, summoning vines and roots to block paths.
