# Puuk

## Visual Description
- **Body:** A small, dragon‑like demonic creature about 1 meter tall. Its skin is glossy black with faint iridescent scales that catch the light like oil on water. It has a long, slender snout, sharp amber eyes, and a pair of tiny, bat‑like wings that allow it to make short, erratic hops. Its tail ends in a spade‑shaped tip that it uses to pry objects from the ground.
- **Age:** No clear age; it appears to be a manifestation of restless, mischievous spirits.
- **Hair:** None.
- **Physical Build:** Agile and wiry, built for quick darting movements and stealing items.

## Motivations
Puuk is driven by a compulsive greed for shiny objects and a love of mischief. It steals items from travelers and stores them in hidden caches, often causing frustration for those who cross its path. It also delights in causing minor chaos, such as tripping caravans or scattering supplies.

## Ties & Relationships
- **Allies:** The Cult of Metsik occasionally summons Puuk to cause distractions during rituals. It may also be tolerated by other mischievous creatures like sprites.
- **Enemies:** The Livonian Order and any vigilant merchants who have suffered loss due to its thefts. Villagers who have been robbed also view it as a nuisance.
- **Initial View of the Main Player (Kalev):** Puuk will observe Kalev’s behavior; if Kalev carries shiny items, Puuk may attempt to steal them, leading to a playful chase. If Kalev shows compassion toward the forest, Puuk may become a reluctant ally.

## History (Biography)
In local folklore, Puuk is said to be the offspring of a cursed fire spirit and a forest imp. It has been sighted near market stalls and caravan routes, where it snatches coins, trinkets, and occasionally important quest items. The cult believes that capturing a Puuk can bring a small amount of luck, but the creature is notoriously hard to catch.

## Daily Routines
Puuk spends its days flitting between forest clearings and human settlements, scouting for glittering objects. It hides its loot in hollow tree trunks or under rocks, returning at night to rearrange its hoard. When threatened, it darts away in a burst of fire‑like sparks.

## Possible Quest Lines

- **Quest Title:** “Chaos in the Market”
  - **Quest Objectives:** Help the market vendors protect their stalls from the Puuk’s raids for a set period, setting traps or bargaining with the creature.
