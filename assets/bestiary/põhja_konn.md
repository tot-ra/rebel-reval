# Põhja Konn

## Visual Description
- **Body:** A colossal amphibian covered in stone‑like armor plates that glint with a muted gray‑blue hue. Its skin resembles weathered granite, with deep cracks pulsing with faint, corrosive acid‑filled veins that hiss when the creature moves.
- **Age:** Ancient; legends claim the Põhja Konn has roamed the wetlands of Estonia since the earliest settlements around Reval.
- **Hair:** None.
- **Physical Build:** Towering over trees, massive and heavily armored. Its belly is broad and soft, the only vulnerable spot, exposed only after a ground‑slam attack.

## Motivations
The Põhja Konn seeks to protect its domain—the sacred swamps and wetlands—from any who would desecrate them. It is driven by a primal urge to maintain the natural balance and to avenge any intrusion by foreign forces or reckless humans.

## Ties & Relationships
- **Allies:** The ancient spirits of the wetlands, the Cult of Metsik, and other mythic fauna such as the Leshy. It may also cooperate with rebel scouts who respect the swamp.
- **Enemies:** The Livonian Order, Danish settlers, and any faction that drains the wetlands or hunts the creature for sport. It harbors a particular hatred for loggers and soldiers who destroy its habitat.
- **Initial View of the Main Player (Kalev):** Kalev will be judged by his actions in the swamp. If he shows reverence for the land, the Põhja Konn may become a reluctant ally or at least a neutral observer. If he harms the wetlands, the creature will attack aggressively.

## History (Biography)
Folklore tells of a great flood that created the marshes of Harju, and the Põhja Konn emerged from the depths as a guardian. Over centuries it has been both feared and revered, appearing in tales of wandering knights who vanished in the bogs. During the St. George’s Night Uprising, the creature was said to have risen to aid the rebels by flooding enemy camps and crushing armored knights with its massive limbs.

## Daily Routines
The Põhja Konn spends most of its time submerged in the swamp, surfacing only to patrol its territory. It feeds on large fish, amphibians, and occasional stray livestock. At night it emits low, resonant croaks that echo across the wetlands, warning intruders. When threatened, it uses its powerful legs to launch devastating ground‑slam attacks and can expel corrosive acid from its cracks to melt armor.

## Possible Quest Lines
- **Quest Title:** “Swamp’s Guardian”
  - **Quest Objectives:** Help the Põhja Konn drive out a detachment of Livonian Order soldiers attempting to drain the swamp. Players must locate the creature, gain its trust (perhaps by offering a sacred relic), and assist in sabotaging the enemy’s equipment.
  - **Rewards:** A “Swampscale Shield” that grants resistance to acid damage, increased reputation with the Cult of Metsik, and lore about the ancient wetlands.

- **Quest Title:** “The Acidic Maw”
  - **Quest Objectives:** Retrieve a stolen artifact that the Põhja Konn has claimed as its own. The player must navigate the treacherous bog, avoid acid pools, and either negotiate with the creature or defeat it to reclaim the item.
  - **Rewards:** The recovered artifact (usable in a later quest), a “Frog’s Tongue” weapon that deals poison damage, and a temporary boost to swamp‑movement speed.

- **Quest Title:** “Echoes of the Bog”
  - **Quest Objectives:** Investigate mysterious disappearances of villagers near the swamp. Discover that a rogue band of mercenaries is hunting the Põhja Konn for its scales. Decide whether to protect the creature or assist the mercenaries.
  - **Rewards:** Choice‑based outcomes: protecting the creature grants a “Blessing of the Wetlands” (health regeneration when near water); aiding mercenaries yields gold and a rare “Swamp Hunter” outfit.
