## ðŸ¦¸ The Hero: Kalev the Smith
You are Kalev, an Estonian smith. To the German lords, you're just another pair of hands to shoe their horses. To your own people, you're a stubborn man with a strong back and a cynical tongue. But there's more to you than meets the eye.

- The Name of a Giant: Your name, "Kalev," is the same as the mythical giant-king. Your strength is unusual, and perhaps there's a flicker of ancient power in your bloodline.
- A Smith's Hands: You see the world through the eyes of a craftsman. Your hammer is not just a tool; it's an extension of your will.
- A Reluctant Rebel: You are not a hero by choice. The uprising is a nuisance that has overturned your life. Your journey is one of survival, but your actions might accidentally inspire hope... or bring about greater ruin. Your dialogue can be witty, sarcastic, or grimly pragmatic, reflecting a man caught in events far larger than himself.
- "Magical" forces. You have some supernatural powers (after you ate mushroom soup). Unlock more by aligning with factions.
