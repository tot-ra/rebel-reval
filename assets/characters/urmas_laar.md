# Urmas Laar

**Visual Description:** A zealot and mystic from the eastern marshlands, blending ancient Finno-Ugric rites with anti-crusader rhetoric. Claimed visions from Taara led him to battle. He has wild, unkempt hair and eyes that seem to look through you. He is draped in animal skins and carries a staff adorned with feathers and bones. He speaks in riddles and prophecies, his voice a low, hypnotic drone.
