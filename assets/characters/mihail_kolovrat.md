# Михаил Коловрат

**Visual Description:** A cunning Pskovian agent operating as a fur trapper. He offers access to spies and saboteurs, but his true allegiance is a mystery. He is dressed in rough furs and leathers, and his face is weathered from the elements. He has sharp, watchful eyes that miss nothing. He carries a hunting knife and a bow, and he moves with the quiet grace of a predator.
