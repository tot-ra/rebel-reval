# Johann von Minden

**Visual Description:** The charismatic and ambitious leader of the Brotherhood of Blackheads. He is a master of public relations and a shrewd negotiator, but his every move serves the Council's secret agenda. He is impeccably dressed in the black robes of the Brotherhood, and he has a charming smile and a way with words that can win over even the most skeptical listener.
