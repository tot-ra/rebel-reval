# Lembit Helme

**Visual Description:** A stern village elder from Harjumaa with a gift for oratory and negotiation. Known for rallying disparate clans with his "fire-sermons" in the forests near Padise. He has a weathered face, a long white beard, and eyes that have seen many winters. He wears simple, homespun clothes, but carries himself with the authority of a king.
