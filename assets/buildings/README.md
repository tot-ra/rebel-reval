## Prompt

An isometric view of ... from medieval Tallinn (Reval), circa 1343. It should fit within a 1024×1024 image, designed to be cut into 128×128 tiles for an RPG with an isometric perspective.

The style should be historically accurate to 14th-century Northern Europe (Hanseatic / Livonian Order architecture). Materials can include limestone, timber-framing, steep gabled roofs with shingles, orange clay tiles or thatch narrow Gothic windows, and wooden doors.

The object must be viewed from a consistent isometric angle (3/4 top-down) with clear, crisp lines and no modern elements. Avoid text, modern signage, or anachronisms. Object is not new, has noticeable signs of aging (cracks, vegitation)

Background should be transparent or minimal, so the building can be placed directly into a game map. Lighting should be even, as if under daylight, with soft shadows consistent across assets. Assume that sun is on bottom-left.

Highly detailed, game-ready sprite, realistic but stylized to read clearly in-game. NO humans or characters present.
