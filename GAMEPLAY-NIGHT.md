# ðŸŒ™ Night Gameplay: The Siege of Reval

At night, the strategic heart of "Reval Rebel" is revealed. The player's goal is to systematically dismantle the ruling factions' control over the city, district by district. This is achieved by capturing the watchtowers that symbolize their power.

## The Tower System

The city of Reval is protected by eight key defensive towers, each representing a crucial chokepoint in the medieval fortification system. These towers are not just symbolic; they are the nerve centers of the rulers' control, coordinating guard patrols and suppressing rebel activity.

### Attackable Towers (Player can attack one per night):

1. **Viru Gate Towers** - Eastern entrance, twin round towers (Danish Crown control)
2. **Maiden's Tower (Neitsitorn)** - Southeastern wall, rectangular tower (City Guard)
3. **Nunna Tower** - Northern wall near St. Michael's nunnery (Livonian Order)
4. **Sauna Tower** - Northern defenses by monastery baths (Livonian Order)
5. **Kuldjala Tower** - Southern wall, "Golden Foot" tower (Hanseatic League)
6. **Munkadetagune Tower** - Near Dominican monastery (City Guard)
7. **Harju Gate Tower** - Southern entrance to PÃ¤rnu road (Danish Crown control)
8. **Hellemann Tower** - Northwestern wall defenses (Livonian Order)
9. **Eppingi Tower** - Significant defensive tower.
10. **Renteni Tower** - An older tower, part of the north-west wall.
11. **Bremeni Tower** - A former prison tower.
12. **Assauwe Tower** - A tower of unknown strength.
13. **Stoltingi Tower** - A tower of unknown strength.
14. **Hattorpe-tagune Tower** - A tower of unknown strength.
15. **Kuradiema Tower** - A tower of unknown strength.

## Capturing a Tower

Capturing a tower is a multi-stage process that requires both careful planning during the day and skillful execution at night.

### 1. Daytime Reconnaissance
- **Scouting:** Observe the tower from a distance to identify guard patrols, entry points, and potential environmental hazards.
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Talk to NPCs in the district to learn about the tower's defenses, the captain's weaknesses, and any secret passages.
- **Preparation:** Craft specialized tools like grappling hooks or smoke bombs, and forge spells tailored to the tower's challenges.

### 2. Night-time Infiltration
- **Stealth Approach:** Use the darkness and your knowledge of the area to bypass patrols and reach the tower undetected.
- **Environmental Puzzles:** Some towers may have environmental puzzles, such as disabling an alarm system or creating a distraction to draw guards away.
- **Ascending the Tower:** Fight or sneak your way up the tower, dealing with guards and traps on each level.

### 3. The Tower Captain
Each tower is commanded by a unique **Tower Captain** with their own backstory, combat style, and special abilities. Defeating the captain is the final step in capturing the tower.

- **Unique Encounters:** Tower Captains are not generic bosses. They are characters with their own motivations and connections to the story.
- **Tactical Challenges:** Each captain will require a different strategy to defeat. Some may be heavily armored knights, while others are cunning assassins or powerful mages.

## Rewards and Consequences

Capturing a tower has a significant impact on the game world.

### Rewards
- **Shifting the Balance of Power:** Capturing a tower deals a major blow to the rulers' control, significantly shifting the "Balance of Power" meter in the rebels' favor.
- **Liberating the District:** The district is now considered "liberated." Rebel flags will fly from the tower, and the general atmosphere will become more hopeful.
- **New Opportunities:** New quests, vendors, and safe houses will become available in the liberated district.
- **Loot and Resources:** The tower itself will contain valuable loot, including crafting materials, gold, and unique equipment.

### Consequences
- **Increased Alertness:** The ruling factions will not take the loss of a tower lightly. Expect increased patrols, more powerful enemies, and even counter-attacks to try and reclaim the tower.
- **Faction Reputation:** Capturing a tower will significantly increase your reputation with the rebel factions and decrease it with the ruling factions.
