# Reval Rebel - Project Summary

## Overview

"Reval Rebel" is an indie Action RPG with rogue-like elements set in a semi-fictional 14th-century Estonia, during the historical St. George's Night Uprising. The game aims for a moody, atmospheric feel, blending Hanseatic trade, Baltic folklore, and early Christianity.

## Core Narrative

The player assumes the role of **Kalev**, a cynical but powerful Estonian smith in the city of Reval (modern-day Tallinn) in the year 1342. Kalev is reluctantly drawn into the escalating conflict between the native Estonian population and the foreign ruling powers. The player's choices will determine the course and outcome of the rebellion.

## Gameplay Mechanics

The game features a dynamic day/night cycle:
*   **Day:** Players engage in crafting, commerce, and information gathering as Kalev the smith.
*   **Night:** Players undertake covert missions, engaging in stealth and combat to advance their faction's goals.

A key feature is the **"Living City"** system, where player actions influence meters for **Rebel Morale (Hope)** and **Civic Order (Fear)**. This creates a dynamic world that reacts to the player's choices, shifting the overall **Balance of Power** between the Rebel and Ruler factions.

## Combat System

Combat is built around a unique spell-forging system. Players can map up to 8 **Elements of Philosophy** (e.g., Fire, Order, Deception) to their keys. By combining these elements in sequences of up to four, players can creatively **forge** a vast array of spells and actions. The system allows for deep tactical flexibility, alongside traditional melee combat and the ability to lead a party of allies.

## Factions

The political landscape is divided into three groups:

*   **Ruling Factions:** Representing order and stability, these include the **Danish Crown**, the **Livonian Order**, and the **Hanseatic League**.
*   **Rebel Factions:** Fighting for freedom, these include the rural **Harju Kings**, the urban **Black Cloaks**, and the pagan **Cult of Metsik**.
*   **Neutral Factions:** Opportunistic groups with their own agendas, such as the **Republic of Novgorod & Pskov**, the **Brotherhood of Blackheads**, and the **Vitalienbrüder** pirates.

Players must choose to align with either the Rulers or the Rebels, and their actions will build or break alliances with these factions.

## Story Progression

The narrative is structured in chapters that mirror the historical timeline of the uprising:
*   **Chapter 1 (The Simmering City):** Focuses on political intrigue and building alliances before the rebellion erupts.
*   **Chapter 2 (The Fire of Rebellion):** Begins on St. George's Night and focuses on open warfare and large-scale battles.
*   **Chapter 3 (The Livonian Crusade):** Expands the conflict to new regions.
*   **Epilogue:** A poignant mini-game set years later, revealing the long-term consequences of the conflict and the arrival of the plague.

## Mini-Games

The core gameplay is enhanced by various mini-games, including tavern brawling, smuggling runs, market haggling, and ritual chanting, adding depth and variety to the player's experience.
