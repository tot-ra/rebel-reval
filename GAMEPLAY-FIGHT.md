## 🔮 The Elements of Philosophy

Magic in Reval is not about chanting arcane words, but about imposing one's philosophical will upon reality. The world is shaped by the interplay of fundamental concepts. By mastering these **Elements of Philosophy**, Kalev can forge his own spells and actions.

There are 21 known Elements, grouped into three domains. While Kalev can learn to understand all of them, he can only hold 8 in his mind at any given time (mapped to QWER/ASDF keys).

#### Primal & Metaphysical Elements
*   🌱 **Life (Elu):** Growth, healing, vitality.

##  blacksmithing: Forging Spells

Spells are not learned from tomes, but **forged** by combining Elements in a sequence of up to 4. The order and combination of Elements determine the final effect. The first Element in the sequence defines the spell's core **intent** or delivery method (e.g., a projectile, a self-buff, an area-of-effect), while subsequent Elements act as **modifiers**, adding properties or altering the effect.

This system allows for immense creativity and tactical flexibility. A player might enter a mission with a set of Elements focused on stealth and illusion, or go in prepared for open warfare with elements of destruction and defense.

### Spellforging Examples

The possibilities are nearly endless, but here are some examples of how Elements can be combined. The final power, cost, and cooldown of a spell are determined by the number and rarity of the Elements used.

| Sequence | Forged Spell | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Fire` | **Spark** | A small, fast projectile of fire. |
| `Fire` + `Air` | **Fireball** | A larger, explosive projectile. The Air element gives it area of effect. |
| `Earth` + `Metal` | **Iron Skin** | (Self-cast) Hardens your skin, granting a significant armor bonus for a short time. |
| `Water` + `Life` | **Healing Mist** | (Area-cast) Creates a mist that heals allies who stand within it. |
| `Mind` + `Deception` | **Illusionary Double** | Creates a clone of yourself that draws enemy fire. |
| `Will` + `Dominion` | **Command: Flee** | (Targeted) Forces a single non-elite enemy to run in terror. |
| `Darkness` + `Space` | **Shadow Step** | Instantly teleport a short distance, remaining unseen. |
| `Hope` + `Light` + `Air` | **Beacon of Hope** | (Area-cast) Creates a beacon of light that heals allies, damages undead, and boosts Rebel Morale. The Air element makes it a wide-area pulse. |
| `Blood` + `Sacrifice` + `Death` | **Hemomancy Curse** | (Targeted) Sacrifice a portion of your own health to place a powerful damage-over-time curse on an enemy that weakens them and heals you if they die while it's active. |
| `Justice` + `Faith` + `Fire` | **Judgement** | Calls down a pillar of holy fire on a target. It deals extra damage to those with high "Fear" scores (e.g., oppressive guards). |
| `Time` + `Time` + `Order` | **Stasis Field** | Creates a zone where time is slowed to a crawl for all but the caster. The Order element stabilizes the effect. |
| `Freedom` + `Beast` + `Will` | **Unleash Spirit** | Temporarily transform into a powerful spectral wolf, gaining immense speed and attack power, breaking free from all bonds. |
