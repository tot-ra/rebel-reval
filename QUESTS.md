# Quests

This document outlines the quests available in "Reval Rebel." Quests are a primary driver of the narrative and a key way for the player to interact with the world and its factions.

## Miscellaneous Quests

These quests are generally not tied to a specific faction and can be discovered by exploring the world and talking to various NPCs.

### The Brewer of Reval
A respected local alewife and healer, Aita, is accused of witchcraft by the local Livonian Order knights. The real reason is economic: her popular herbal ales are cutting into the profits of the knights' own brewery, which they recently established to fund their activities.

- **"A Bitter Brew":** The player is asked to investigate a strange illness spreading through the lower town. The knights claim it's caused by Aita's "cursed" beer. The player gathers ingredients for Aita, speaks with afflicted townspeople, and can choose to investigate the knights' brewery. The twist is that the player discovers the knights are using contaminated water for their own beer, either through negligence or sabotage, and are using Aita as a scapegoat.
- **"The Old Ways":** Aita asks the player to retrieve a rare herb from a sacred grove, a place the knights have forbidden access to. This would be a stealth or combat encounter, where the player has to evade or fight Livonian Order patrols. The player can deliver the herb to Aita, or betray her to the knights for a reward and faction reputation.
- **"Judgment by Fire":** Aita is captured and is to be put to a "trial by ordeal." The player can choose to create a distraction to help her escape, use their smithing skills to rig the ordeal in her favor, publicly defend her, risking their own reputation, or let the trial proceed, with consequences for the town's morale and the looming uprising.

- **"The Silent Baker":** A mute baker's loaves cause strange, vivid hallucinations. Is he a prophet receiving divine visions, a poisoner working for a hidden faction, or simply using tainted flour?
- **"The Elk with the Iron Eye":** A mythical, ancient elk is said to roam the forests around Reval. It is said that the player's ancestor made a pact with the beast and now a debt is due. The player must find a way to appease the creature before it comes to collect.
- **"Ashes for Amber":** A grieving widow asks the player to retrieve her husband's bones from a knight's crypt. She offers a piece of magical amber in return, said to ward off evil spirits.
- **"The Copper Rat":** A network of spies is using enchanted rats to carry messages through the city's sewers. The player is tasked with uncovering this network, which could lead them into the heart of a conspiracy.

## Faction Quests

### The Livonian Order

- **"The Heretic Hunt":** A charismatic preacher has been spreading a new, heretical doctrine among the peasantry. The Order tasks the player with infiltrating the preacher's followers, identifying the ringleaders, and marking them for arrest.
- **"A Knight's Honor":** A knight of the Order has been accused of cowardice in a recent skirmish. The player must investigate the incident, gather testimony, and either clear the knight's name or confirm his guilt.
- **"The Relic":** The Order believes a powerful holy relic is hidden somewhere in the city. The player must follow a trail of clues to find it before it falls into the wrong hands.

### The Hanseatic Merchants

- **"The Guild's Gambit":** A rival merchant guild is undercutting prices and stealing business. The player is hired to sabotage the rival guild's operations, whether through theft, spreading rumors, or disrupting their supply lines.
- **"The Debt Collector":** A nobleman has defaulted on a significant loan. The player is sent to collect the debt, by any means necessary.
- **"The Spice of Life":** A shipment of rare and valuable spices has been stolen from a Hanseatic warehouse. The player must track down the thieves and recover the goods.

### The Bandits

- **"The Swedish Gambit":** A charismatic bandit leader, hearing of the player's exploits, offers a risky proposition: travel to a Swedish outpost and persuade the local bailiff to fund their operations in exchange for creating chaos and weakening the Order's grip on the region.

### The Estonian Rebels

- **"The Whispering Walls":** The rebels need to spread their message of defiance. The player is tasked with painting rebel symbols on key buildings throughout the city under the cover of night, avoiding guard patrols.
- **"The Armory Heist":** The rebels are in desperate need of weapons. The player must plan and execute a raid on a Livonian Order armory to secure arms for the uprising.
- **"The Emissary":** The rebels need to send a secret message to a potential ally in a nearby town. The player must carry the message, avoiding ambushes and patrols along the way.

### The Pskov Faction

- **"The Border Crossing":** The player must smuggle a Pskovian agent into Reval, navigating treacherous roads and avoiding Order patrols to deliver them safely to a safehouse in the city.
- **"The Pskovian Pact":** After gaining the trust of the Pskovian agent, the player is sent on a critical mission to the borderlands to meet a representative of the Prince of Pskov. The goal is to forge an alliance and convince the Pskovians to join the fight against their common enemy, the Livonian Order.
