# Introduction Scene: The Forging of Chains

**Game Scene:** `intro.tscn`

This scene serves as the game's introduction, setting the stage for the story and introducing the player to the world of 14th-century Reval. It is a cinematic prequel chapter where the player witnesses the forging of the chains that the main character, Kalev, will later try to break.

**Setting:** A sacred oak grove in Harju County, circa 1219. The air is thick with the smell of damp earth, moss, and the faint, sweet scent of burning offerings. An ancient, massive oak tree, its branches like gnarled arms reaching for the sky, stands at the center of a clearing. Carved wooden idols stand guard around it.

**Characters:**

*   **Lembitu**, a chieftain of the Sakala people and an ancestor of Kalev. He is a powerful man in his prime, with a long, braided beard and eyes that burn with a fierce, protective fire. He wears a wolf-pelt cloak over his leather armor.
*   **Aita**, Lembitu's young daughter, about ten years old. She has her father's fiery spirit but her mother's gentle heart.
*   **The Volkhv**, an old pagan priest, his face a mask of wrinkles and his eyes holding the wisdom of generations. He is the keeper of the old ways.
*   **Valdemar II**, the King of Denmark, a tall, imposing figure in shining mail, his face a mask of cold, righteous fury.
*   **Archbishop Anders Sunesen**, a man whose piety is matched only by his ruthlessness. He carries a golden cross that glints in the firelight.
*   **Danish Knights**, a faceless, disciplined force of destruction, their shields bearing the white cross on a red field.

**(The scene opens with a wide shot of the sacred grove. The sun is setting, casting long, ominous shadows. The Volkhv is leading a ritual at the base of the great oak. Lembitu stands guard, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. Aita watches from a safe distance, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and fear.)**

**VOLKHV**
(Chanting in an ancient, guttural tongue)
*Ukko, Lord of the Sky, hear us...*
*Taara, Protector of the Forest, watch over us...*
*The iron birds have come, their shadows long and cold...*
*Grant us the strength to drive them from our lands...*

**(Suddenly, the sound of a horn shatters the peace. It is a sound of conquest, not of celebration. Lembitu draws his sword, his face grim.)**

**LEMBITU**
They have found us. Aita, run! Hide!

**(Aita hesitates, her eyes fixed on her father.)**

**LEMBITU**
(Roaring)
NOW!

**(Aita turns and flees into the forest as the first of the Danish knights burst into the clearing. They are a wave of steel and faith, their swords drawn, their eyes burning with righteous zeal. The Volkhv continues his chant, his voice rising in defiance.)**

**ARCHBISHOP SUNESEN**
(Stepping forward, his voice booming)
In the name of God and King Valdemar, I command you to cease this devil worship! Cast down your idols and bow before the one true cross!

**(The Volkhv spits on the ground.)**

**VOLKHV**
Your god has no power here, priest. This is the land of Taara, and you are trespassers.

**(Valdemar II steps forward, his hand on his sword.)**

**VALDEMAR II**
We are not trespassers. We are saviors. We bring light to this dark land. You will accept our god and our rule, or you will be cleansed by fire and sword.

**(Lembitu steps between the king and the priest, his sword held ready.)**

**LEMBITU**
This is our land. Our gods. You will have neither.

**(Valdemar II smiles, a cold, cruel smile.)**

**VALDEMAR II**
So be it.

**(The king gives a signal, and the knights charge. The battle is short and brutal. Lembitu fights like a cornered wolf, his sword a blur of motion, but he is outnumbered and outmatched. He cuts down two knights before a sword blow to the leg sends him to his knees. The other Estonians are quickly overwhelmed.)**

**(As Lembitu struggles to rise, he sees the Archbishop raise his golden cross.)**

**ARCHBISHOP SUNESEN**
Let the light of Christ shine upon this heathen darkness!

**(At his command, the knights begin to chop at the base of the great oak with axes. The sound of the steel biting into the ancient wood is like a scream. The Volkhv cries out in anguish as the tree, the heart of their faith, begins to tremble.)**

**(From her hiding place in the woods, Aita watches in horror. She sees her father, wounded and defeated. She sees the knights, their faces grim and determined. She sees the great oak, the tree she has known her whole life, begin to fall.)**

**(The tree crashes to the ground with a deafening roar, sending a shower of leaves and splinters into the air. The clearing falls silent, save for the crackling of the fires the knights have started. The wooden idols are thrown into the flames, their carved faces seeming to twist in agony.)**

**(Valdemar II walks over to the fallen Lembitu. He places the tip of his sword under the chieftain's chin.)**

**VALDEMAR II**
Your gods are dead. Your land is mine. You will serve me, or you will join your ancestors in the dirt.

**(Lembitu looks up at the king, his eyes filled with a hatred that will burn for generations. He says nothing, but his silence is a vow of defiance.)**

**(The camera focuses on Aita's face, her eyes wide with terror and a dawning, cold fury. She is witnessing the birth of a legacy of hatred, a debt that will be passed down from father to son, from mother to daughter, until it is finally paid in blood.)**

**(The scene fades to black. The sound of the crackling flames and the distant, triumphant hymns of the Danes are the only sounds that remain.)**
