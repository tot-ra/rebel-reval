## ðŸŽ­ Historical Context
The State of Estonia in 1342: On paper, Northern Estonia is the Duchy of Estonia, a dominion of the Danish Crown, ruled by a viceroy from Toompea Castle. In reality, Danish power is a hollow shell. The true authority lies with a web of competing interests:

- The German Vassals: Feudal lords who control the land and its people, loyal to the Danish king only when it suits them.
- The Livonian Order: A powerful, semi-independent military order of German knights who act as the region's de facto army and landlords. They have their own agenda and often operate in defiance of the Danish crown.
- The Hanseatic League: The wealthy German merchants of Reval, who operate with a high degree of autonomy and are primarily concerned with protecting their trade routes and profits.

This fractured power structure has created a powder keg of resentment and ambition, where the native Estonian population is caught between a distant king, foreign knights, and wealthy merchants, all of whom see the land and its people as a resource to be exploited.

The Seeds of Rebellion: The St. George's Night Uprising is not a sudden event, but the culmination of decades of simmering resentment. The key grievances include:
- Heavy Taxation: The Danish Crown, weakened and distracted by its own internal politics, has imposed increasingly heavy taxes on the Estonian population to fund its distant ambitions.
- Cultural and Religious Oppression: The German-speaking ruling class and the Catholic Church have systematically suppressed Estonian culture, language, and pagan beliefs.
- Economic Exploitation: The Hanseatic merchants of Reval control the flow of trade, enriching themselves while the local population sees little benefit.
- Loss of Land and Freedom: The rights of free Estonian peasants have been steadily eroded, with many forced into serfdom by the German feudal lords.


## The Uprising in Reality: A Brief Historical Account
The St. George's Night Uprising (1343â€“1345) was a widespread and brutal rebellion by the indigenous Estonian population against the Danish and German rulers who had dominated the land for over a century. It was not a single event, but a series of coordinated attacks that aimed to eradicate foreign influence and restore Estonian independence.

The rebellion began on St. George's Night, April 23, 1343, with a signal fire lit on a hill in Harju County. This sparked a wave of violence across Danish Estonia. Estonian forces, led by four self-proclaimed "kings," targeted German nobles, merchants, and clergy. They burned manors, destroyed churches, and laid siege to the city of Reval (Tallinn). One of the most infamous events was the massacre at Padise Monastery, where 28 Cistercian monks were killed.

Despite initial successes, the rebellion was ultimately crushed. The Estonian forces, though numerous, lacked the military sophistication of their enemies. Desperate for allies, the rebels sent envoys to both the Swedish bailiffs in Finland and the Russian city of Pskov. While the Swedes offered promises of support, no significant aid arrived in time. There is no historical record of Pskov providing any assistance. Left to fend for themselves, the Estonians were no match for the disciplined knights of the Teutonic Order, who intervened decisively to expand their own territory. By the end of 1343, the uprising in mainland Estonia was suppressed, though resistance continued on the island of Saaremaa until early 1345.

In the aftermath, the Danish Crown, its authority shattered, sold the Duchy of Estonia to the Teutonic Order in 1346. The uprising, while a failure, remains a powerful symbol of Estonian resistance and the enduring desire for self-determination.
