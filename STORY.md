## Storyline / Level progression
### Prequel Chapter: The First Spark
A short, narrative-driven prologue where you play as one of Kalev's ancestors during the initial Danish conquest. This chapter would establish the historical context and the deep-seated resentment that fuels the main story, allowing the player to witness the forging of the chains that Kalev will later try to break.

### Chapter 1: The Simmering City (year 1342)
- Gameplay Focus: Political intrigue, stealth, and character development. This phase is about building your power and choosing your allies.
- Player Goal: Navigate the treacherous social landscape of Reval. Your actions will build your reputation with different factions, unlocking unique abilities and story paths. Every choice you make determines who will stand with you—and who will stand against you—when the city finally erupts.
- Narrative Arc: This phase is a slow-burn thriller. You'll uncover conspiracies, perform secret missions for different factions, and make difficult choices that have no clear right answer. The "Living City" meters (Hope, Fear, Chaos) are your primary measure of progress.

- **Chapter Conclusion:** The chapter concludes on the eve of St. George's Night, April 23, 1343. The player's actions throughout the chapter accumulate towards this date, influencing the city's state via the **Hope, Fear, and Chaos** meters. The final quests of this chapter will represent the tipping point, and the state of the meters at the end of the day will determine the opening scenario of Chapter 2, defining the strength and nature of the rebellion.

### Chapter 2: The Fire of Rebellion (year 1343)
- Gameplay Focus: Open warfare, tactical combat, and large-scale battles. This phase begins on St. George's Night, April 23, 1343.
- Player Goal: Survive and lead your chosen faction to victory. For the rebels, this means fighting for independence and driving out the foreign lords. For the rulers, this means crushing the uprising, restoring order, and punishing the seditious. Your missions will be based on the real-life timeline of the rebellion, allowing you to either follow history or rewrite it:
- The Siege of Reval: Help the Estonian rebels in their attempt to take the city, or side with the Livonian Order to break the siege.
- The Battle of Pärnu: Engage in a major field battle against the knights, either as a rebel warrior or an Order champion.
- The Swedish/Pskov Gambit: As a rebel, attempt to secure aid from neighbours. As a ruler, sabotage the rebels' efforts and ensure no foreign aid arrives.
- Narrative Arc: This phase is a desperate, action-packed struggle for the future of Estonia. The choices you made in Phase 1 will have dramatic consequences, determining which missions are available to you and what resources you have at your disposal.

### Chapter 3: The Livonian Crusade
The conflict expands beyond Reval. The Teutonic Order, having bought the rights to Estonia, launches a full-scale crusade to solidify its control. The player would travel to new regions, from the swamps of Saaremaa to the fortified cities of Livonia, participating in large-scale battles and sieges. This chapter would introduce new factions, such as the Samogitians or other Baltic tribes, who could be potential allies or enemies.

### Epilogue
The screen fades to black. A child's laughter echoes, then is abruptly silenced. The year 1351 appears on the screen, then fades.
- **Locations:** [Reval Lower Town](./scenes/lower_town/), [Reval Upper Town](./scenes/upper_town/)

The scene opens on a strangely empty Reval. The sun is shining, but the streets are quiet. The player is no longer Kalev. Instead, they control a small child, a girl in a simple linen dress, clutching a rag doll.

**The Game of Tag: A Mini-Game**

The epilogue is a short, deceptively innocent mini-game. The player, as the child, runs through the streets of Reval, looking for people to play with.

*   **Gameplay:** The gameplay is a simple game of "tag." The player moves the child through the city, and when they find an NPC, they can run up and "tag" them. The NPC will laugh, pat the child on the head, and then go about their business. The goal is to "tag" as many people as possible before the sun sets.
*   **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is bright and cheerful, a stark contrast to the grim reality of the main game. The sound design is filled with the sounds of a bustling city, birds chirping, and the child's happy laughter.
*   **The Twist:** As the sun begins to set, the child grows tired and sits down in the town square. The camera slowly zooms out, and the player begins to see the consequences of their "game." Every NPC the player tagged is now lying dead in the streets, a faint, dark aura around them. The child, the innocent carrier of the plague, has unknowingly brought death to everyone they touched.
*   **Ending:** The screen fades to black, and a single line of text appears: "And so, the plague came to Reval." The game ends.
